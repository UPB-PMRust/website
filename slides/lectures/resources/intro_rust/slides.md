# Variables in Rust: const

### A few characteristics:
- **Usage**: For values known at compile time that will never change;
- **Immutable**: Constants cannot be changed after they are defined.
- **Compile-Time Known**: The value must be known at compile time.
- **Usual Location in Embedded**: Flash / ROM (with the code) - in other words - it is inlined (so no runtime allocation);
- **Naming Convention**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE

``` rust 
//EXAMPLES

const MAX_UC_SPEED i16: 150;

const SECONDS_PER_HOUR: u32 = 3600;

const PI_VAL: f32 = 3.14159;

const MAGIC_NUMBER i64: 43248578;

# Variables in Rust: let

### A few characteristics:

- **Usage**: For values unknown at compile time that will not change once an initial value is set (for example- values that are read from a config file at boot time);
- **Immutable by Default**: Variables declared with let are immutable; 
- **Runtime Known**: The value is determined at runtime, usually unknown at compile time; 
- **Usual Location in Embedded**: Stored in SRAM (RAM) since it's allocated at runtime.
- **Naming Convention**: snake_case

```rust
//EXAMPLES

let board_id = get_board_id(); 

let WiFi_id = read_WiFi_id_from_config(); 

let AES_key: [u8; 32] = read_AES_key_from_OTP(); 
// AES-256 key



```

# Variables in Rust: let mut

- **Usage**: For variables holding values that might change during program execution.
- **Mutable**: Variables declared with let mut are mutable and can be reassigned after initialization.
- **Runtime Known**: The value is determined at runtime, usually unknown at compile time; 
- **Usual Location in Embedded**: Stored in SRAM (RAM) because it can change during program execution.
- **Naming Convention**: snake_case

```rust
//EXAMPLE

let mut signal = [0u8, 64];

loop {

read_adc_signal(&mut signal); 
let mut max_fft_value = get_max_fft_value(&signal);

}

# Variables: Copy in Rust

### A few observations:

- Intuitive and simple for types that implement the `Copy` trait:
- - primitive types: `i32`, `f64`, `bool`, `char`
- - tuples composed of primitive types
- You need to pay attention for types that do not implement the `Copy` trait. E.g.:
- - `String`
- - `Vec <_>`

:: right::

``` rust
//EXAMPLE with int
fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 128;  // `x` is an integer (implements `Copy`)
    let y: i32 = x;  // y copies the value of x
    println!("x = {}, y = {}", x, y);  
// Compiles & prints expected value
}

//EXAMPLE with String
fn main() {
    let wifi_name_1 = String::from("RoEduNet");  
// `wifi_name_1` owns the string
    let wifi_name_2 = wifi_name_1;  
// Ownership moves from `wifi_name_1` to `wifi_name_2`
    println!("{}", wifi_name_2);  
// Compiles & prints expected value
    println!("{}", wifi_name_1);  
// compiler ERROR: value borrowed after move
}

```

# Variables: Solution for copy for String (example)

### A few observations:

- `.clone()` performs a copy of the data
- Unlike a move, both WiFiName_1 and WiFiName_2 remain valid and independent of each other (as expected)
- you can do this on data types that support the `clone` method, e.g.:
- - `String`
- - `Vec <_>`

::right::

```rust 
fn main() {
    let wifi_name_1  = String::from("RoEduNet");
    let wifi_name_2 = wifi_name_1.clone();  
    // Creates a copy (clone) of the string

    println!("wifi_name_1 = {}", wifi_name_1);      
    println!("wifi_name_2 = {}", wifi_name_2);

    // Both lines compiles & print expected value

}
```

# Variables: Simple borrow example

- `&wifi_name_1` creates an immutable reference to wifi_name_1 without transferring ownership.
- Both wifi_name_1 and wifi_name_2 can be used simultaneously.
- Since it's an immutable reference, you cannot modify wifi_name_1 through wifi_name_2.

::right::

```rust

fn main() {
    let wifi_name_1 = String::from("RoEduNet");  
    let wifi_name_2 = &wifi_name_1;  
    // Borrows wifi_name_1 (immutable reference)

    println!("{}", wifi_name_2); //compiler dropes the reference  
    println!("{}", wifi_name_1);  
    // Both lines compile & print expected value
}

fn main() {
    let wifi_name_1 = String::from("RoEduNet");  
    let wifi_name_2 = &wifi_name_1;  
    // Borrows wifi_name_1 (immutable reference)

    wifi_name_2.push_str("edu_roam");
    //compiler error: cannot borrow `*wifi_name_2` 
    //as mutable, as it is behind a `&` reference

    println!("{}", wifi_name_2);  
    println!("{}", wifi_name_1);  
    //code does not compile
}

# Variables: How to modify

::right::

```rust

fn main() {
    let mut wifi_name_1 = String::from("RoEduNet");    
    //mutable so it can be modified.
    let wifi_name_2 = &mut wifi_name_1; // Mut borrow  

    wifi_name_2.push_str("_5G");  

    println!("{}", wifi_name_2);  
    println!("{}", wifi_name_1);  
    //! NOTE: works with newer compiler versions 
    //(with non-lexical lifetimes (NLL) feature) 

}

//EX2
fn main() {
    let mut wifi_name_1 = String::from("RoEduNet");  
    let wifi_name_2 = &mut wifi_name_1 ;  

    wifi_name_2.push_str("_5G");  

    println!("{}", wifi_name_2);  
    println!("{}", wifi_name_1);  
    wifi_name_2.push_str("_high_speed");  
    //compiler error:  cannot borrow `wifi_name_1` 
    //as immutable because it is also borrowed as mut
}

# A look at the compiler

```rust

fn integer_division (a:isize, b: isize) -> isize {
     a / b
}

fn main () {
  let x = 120;
  let y = 0;
  
  println! ("{}:{} = {}", 
 x, y, integer_division (x, y));
   
}

```


::right::

<br>
<br>

```rust {all}{lines:false}

...
...

// Check for division by zero
bb2: {
    _4 = Eq(copy _2, const 0_isize);
    assert(!move _4, "attempt to divide `{}` by zero",
copy _1) -> [success: bb3, unwind continue];
}

// Check for potential overflow caused by
// dividing `isize::MIN` by `-1`
bb3: {
    _5 = Eq(copy _2, const -1_isize);
    _6 = Eq(copy _1, const isize::MIN);
    _7 = BitAnd(move _5, move _6);
    assert(!move _7, "attempt to compute `{} / {}`,
which would overflow", copy _1, copy _2) -> [success: bb4,
unwind continue];
}

...

```

# A better way to do this

```rust

fn integer_division(a: isize, b: isize) -> Option<isize> {
    if b == 0 {
        None
    } else {
        Some(a / b)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = 120;
    let y = 0;
    match integer_division(x, y) {
        Some(d) => println!("{} / {} = {}", x, y, d),
        None => println!("division by 0"),
    }
    println!("{} / {} = {:?}", x, y, integer_division(x, y));
}


```
