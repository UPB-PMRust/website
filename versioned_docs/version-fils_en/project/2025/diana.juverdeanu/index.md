## Description

I grew up surrounded by pets  at home, and one recurring challenge we faced as a family was planning vacations. We often had to limit our travel plans because it was difficult to find someone reliable to feed our pets while we were away. This inspired me to design a Smart Pet Feeder system built using a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W and Rust. The feeder dispenses food at scheduled times or remotely via wi-fi control. To make pet care more convenient and give pet owners more freedom and peace of mind when traveling.

## Motivation

I believe this could be a practical solution to real-life problems I've faced. Even if the project might seem a bit silly, Iâ€™m excited to have fun working with the hardware I've invested in.

## Architecture 

Main Components:

![Architecture](./assets/schema1v2.webp)

Raspberry Pico 2W: Acts as the central processing unit for the Pet Feeder, controlling the sensors and motors.

Ultrasonic Distance Sensor HC-SR04+: Detects when a pet is near the feeder.

Servo Motor SG92R: Drives the mechanism to dispense the pet food.

Power Supply: Provides the necessary power to all components at 5V.
 
ESP32-CAM with OV2640: Used for capturing real time images.

Wi-Fi Module: Facilitates communication with external devices.

Connection Overview:

The Raspberry Pi Pico 2W acts as the central controller of the Pet Feeder, directly interfacing with the ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04+) and the SG92R servomotor. When the pet approaches the feeder, the sensor detects proximity, and the Pico 2W automatically activates the servo to dispense food. The Pico also runs a Wi-Fi access point and hosts a local web server, allowing the owner to manually trigger feeding from a browser interface. Capturing real time images is handled separately by the ESP32-CAM, which streams real-time footage to the owner. The SG92R servomotor is responsible for physically releasing food from a dedicated container, and is powered by a 5V supply. The ultrasonic distance sensor also helps ensure that food is only dispensed when the pet is actually near. This architecture ensures seamless interaction between sensing, actuation, and user control, enabling both automatic and manual feeding through reliable, Wi-Fi-based communication, with the Pico 2W orchestrating core functions while the ESP32-CAM provides independent visual monitoring.
