## Description

Pip-Boy 2000 is a device that is mounted on someone's wrist and contains various sensors and modules
in order to track the wearer's well being and the surrounding environment. The recorded data is displayed
on a LCD screen and the wearer can cycle through it by pressing buttons on the device. To ensure
the device's safety, to be used it needs to scan the wearer's fingerprint when mounted.

## Motivation

I always wanted to try tech from games I played or that fascinated me and the Fallout universe is
one of the most interesting worlds in gaming fiction, so I thought that I should try to
build something from it and the Pip-Boy 2000 seemed the obvious choice.

## Hardware

1. **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W**
- Processes the data recieved from the sensors and sends it to the screen
- Stores GPS coordinates that the wearer wants saved
2. **Barometric Pressure Sensor BMP280 GY**
- Measures atmosferic pressure and temperature
3. **GPS GY-NEO6MV2 with antenna**
- Uses radio waves and satelite navigation to determine coordinates
4. **Pulse Sensor MAX30100**
- Measures the wearers pulse
5. **Optic Fingerprint Sensor**
- Used to start the device, only reacts to wearer's fingerprint
6. **LCD Screen 1.44 inch diag (128x128 px)**
- Displays data from the sensors, can cycle through multiple screens
7. **Step-up Module MT3608**
- Used to amplify the tension for the fingerprint sensor
8. **Other stuff**
- Batteries, wires, breadboard, resistors, buttons
