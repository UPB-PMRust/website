## Description

The device can be connected between an electric musical instrument and an amplifier. \
It can apply sound effects to the signal generated by the instrument. \
It can also function as a looping station (it records sequences of sound and plays them back repeatedly).

## Motivation

I have a passion for music and I've always wanted such a device. \
I think it's more fun to make it myself than to buy one. \
I also don't always have and entire musical band with me when I want to entertain my friends and a looping station would be awesome.

## Hardware

An electric guitar pickup is just a coil with magnets (the magnetized strings) vibrating around it.
These vibrations induce in the coil an electrical current which is normally conducted though an audio cable to an amplifier.

In my project, the aim is to take that current, send it to Rusty Musician device, and do funky stuff with it before sending it to the amplifier.

First of all, the input is be preprocessed with a passive low-pass filter that has a threshold as high as the highest note on the guitar.
This ensures the signal is as clean as possible before sending it to the ADC on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and processing it using software written in Rust for the RP2350 MCU.

Multiple buttons (with pull-up resistors) are used to select options from the menu (cycle between live effects or select the loop station function).
The options are shown on an LCD screen.

For certain effects and for looping, storage space is needed.
This is achieved by using an external microSD module and an external non-volatile memory.

The processed signal is sent to an external DAC module, filtered again, and ultimately sent to the amplifier.
