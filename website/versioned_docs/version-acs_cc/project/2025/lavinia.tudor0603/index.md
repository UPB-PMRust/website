## Description

Weather Window is an automatic smart window that constantly monitors indoor temperature, humidity, and air quality.
It also gathers external weather data — such as temperature, humidity, and approximate rain probability (based on humidity and pressure) —  transmitting data to the main display unit.
The system automatically determines whether opening the window is necessary to improve indoor conditions.
A display that presents real-time information about the surrounding environment, both indoor and outdoor, and provides personalized recommendations for users, such as clothing suggestions ("It's cold — dress warmly") or alerts ("It might rain — take an umbrella").

## Motivation

"Weather Window" was first imagined during a high school project, inspired by the idea of creating a living environment that adjusts itself for better comfort and health.
Today, with the opportunity to work with real technologies, I am determined to turn that early vision into reality.
This project is not just a technical challenge, but also a personal dream to contribute to smarter, healthier, and more sustainable homes.

## Architecture 

![Description of Image](diagr.svg)
The system is based on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W, connected to environmental sensors (BME280, BMP280, MQ-2 Gas Sensor) and LCD display via I2C + a stepper motor driver (ULN2003) via GPIO. The Pico collects indoor and outdoor data, displays it, and controls the window motor automatically based on the conditions.
