## Description

This handheld mini-console delivers a diverse collection of engaging numeric mini-games, controlled by dual keypads for both solo brain teasers like Sudoku and competitive two-player challenges. Players can test their calculation speed, memory of number sequences, and reaction time in intense 1v1 battles across multiple rounds, with scores tallied to determine the winner.

## Motivation

I chose this project because it taps into something I enjoy: the simple joy of accessible gaming. The idea of creating a small, portable, and cheap mini-arcade that doesn't need a computer is exciting. It's reminiscent of retro consoles, from a time when fun activities weren't always about intense competition. Focusing on straightforward, engaging numeric mini-games controlled by keypads offers a cool mix of nostalgia and something a bit different, emphasizing quick thinking and friendly rivalry.

I also thought it would be interesting to try and connect a USB keyboard to a microcontroller using Rust (without the TinyUSB C bindings).

## Architecture 

### Hardware Integration

- The Raspberry Pi Pico 2W acts as the central processing unit, running the software.
- The display is driven by the Pico 2W to provide the visual interface for all menus, games, and feedback.
- The SD module integrated in the TFT display module allows for writing and reading leaderboard scores.
- The buzzer, connected to a GPIO pin on the Pico 2W, provides simple audio cues.
- The USB hub allows the Pico 2W to receive input from the two keypads.
- LEDs are used for additional visual feedback.

## Log

### Week 28 April - 4 May

- ordered hardware components
- soldered headers to the microcontroller
- performed USB tests

### Week 5 - 11 May

- ordered more hardware components
- wrote the HID driver for the cotton\_usb\_host crate
- tested the SD card reader, display, LEDs and buzzer

### Week 12 - 18 May

- ordered the numeric keypads and the USB hub
- created the channel to pass keystrokes from the usb_task to the main task
- started working on minigames
- updated the KiCad schematic (couldn't find common cathode LEDs; updated to common anode)

My plan for the next week is to finish the minigames, and also create a 3D printed enclosure for the device to improve the overall look.

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Pico 2W - The microcontroller
- 2.2'' LCD TFT SPI 320x240 ILI9341 display - Display and SD module
- 2x A4Tech NumericPad Fstyler FK13 USB Black - User Input
- LOGILINK Hub USB 2.0 4 ports - Join Keyboards to allow connecting to MCU USB
- Active Buzzer - Audio feedback
- LEDs - Additional visual feedback
