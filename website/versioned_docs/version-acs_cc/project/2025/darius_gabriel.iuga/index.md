## Description

This project implements an interactive Minesweeper game, controlled via a joystick (for navigation) and buttons (for placing flags/menu interaction), with output displayed on an LCD screen. The player sets the grid size and the number of mines through a graphical menu, adjusting values with the joystick. At the end of the game, sounds (via a passive buzzer) signal victory or explosion. If a mine explodes, a vibration motor will be activated.

Game states can be saved locally (on a microSD card). Saved maps can be visualized on a dedicated website, served by an HTTP server hosted on the Pico W.

## Motivation

I chose to implement Minesweeper over other games because it seemed to offer an appropriate level of difficulty (harder than Tic-Tac-Toe or Space Invaders, but easier than Chess). By using the chosen peripherals and incorporating save/load functionality, along with the ability to view saved games via a web interface, I hope to provide an engaging gameplay loop for the player.

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 5 - 11 May

I bought the hardware components from Optimus Digital and soldered the headers on 2 picos, as well as some jumper wires for the SD card interfaces.

### Week 12 - 18 May

I couldn't get probe-rs to work, so I ended up working with only one pico. Debugging is done via USB. The runner in config.toml was changed from probe-rs to picotool.
This is how you can run the project:

1. Plug in the USB while holding BOOTSEL if you want to change the firmware.
2. `cargo run`
3. Run `sudo minicom -b 115200 -o -D /dev/ttyACM0` to view the debug messages in a separate terminal. You need to install minicom on your system.
4. Exit from minicom with Ctrl+A, X

I assembled all of the hardware and wrote code for debugging via USB, initializing the display, and testing the buzzer, vibration motor and buttons.

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

The project utilizes a Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller as the central processing unit. User interaction is handled by a biaxial joystick for grid navigation and menu control, along with several push buttons for actions like placing flags, restarting, accessing the menu, and potentially other features. Visual feedback is provided through a 2.8" SPI LCD display (ILI9341 controller). Audio and haptic feedback are implemented using a passive buzzer and a vibration motor. Game state persistence and map storage are managed using a microSD card connected via SPI. The Pico W's wireless capability is used to host a local HTTP server, allowing saved maps to be viewed remotely. A second Pico is used as a debug probe (Picoprobe).

Here are some pics to see how the project is assembled.
