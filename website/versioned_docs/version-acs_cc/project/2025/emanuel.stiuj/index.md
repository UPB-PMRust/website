## Description

This project is a wireless-controlled car that interacts with two Ubuntu-based applications. It receives movement commands via Bluetooth from a terminal app and sends real-time feedback over Wi-Fi to a second app. The car is equipped with three ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles, helping it avoid front collisions. Signal lights clearly indicate the car’s power status and turning direction, ensuring easy monitoring and intuitive operation.
## Motivation

This project was inspired by a strong interest in cars and remote-controlled systems. It provided an opportunity to better understand how various components, such as microcontrollers, motor drivers, sensors, and communication modules, interact in a real-world embedded system. Working on this allowed for both creative and technical exploration, combining hardware and software to build something functional, interactive, and fun.

## Architecture 

![Architecture](bluetooth_car.svg)

#### System Architecture

The system is built around a central microcontroller, the **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W**, which interfaces with multiple peripherals to enable wireless control and feedback:

- **Bluetooth (HC-05 module)**: Connects to the Pico via **UART** for serial communication, receiving commands from an Ubuntu terminal app over the **Bluetooth Serial Port Profile (SPP)**. The HC-05 operates typically as a slave device, allowing the app to initiate and send control data.
- **Motor Driver (L298N)**: Receives **PWM** signals (for speed control) and **GPIO** signals (for direction control) from the Pico to drive DC motors. The L298N provides high-current output to the motors based on the Pico’s low-power signals.
- **Ultrasonic Sensors (3 units)**: Measure distance to obstacles and detect potential collisions in multiple directions, providing digital input to the Pico for real-time obstacle avoidance.
- **LEDs**: Controlled via **GPIO pins** to provide visual feedback on system states (e.g., power status or turning left/right).
- **Power Supply (2x 18650 batteries)**: Supplies power to the L298N motor driver directly (typically at 7.4V) and to the Pico through a voltage regulator (e.g., 5V step-down converter) to ensure stable operation.

#### Flow of Control

1. The Ubuntu terminal app sends commands wirelessly to the HC-05 module via **Bluetooth SPP**.
2. The HC-05 relays these commands to the Pico over **UART**, where they are interpreted by the firmware.
3. The Pico processes the commands and generates **PWM** and **GPIO** signals to the L298N, controlling motor speed and direction.
4. The three **ultrasonic sensors** continuously measure distances to nearby objects. If a potential collision is detected, the Pico overrides the received commands to stop the motors.
5. The Pico sends real-time feedback data over **Wi-Fi** to a second Ubuntu-based application for monitoring.
6. **LEDs** are toggled via GPIO to provide visual feedback on system states (e.g., power status, or turning left/right).
