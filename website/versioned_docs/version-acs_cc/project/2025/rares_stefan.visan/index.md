## Description

This project implements a physical Tic-Tac-Toe (X and O) game using a 16x16 LED matrix display driven by a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W. Players interact with the game using ultrasonic distance sensors, pointing with their hands to select grid positions. A passive buzzer provides audio feedback, and two physical buttons are used for confirming moves and resetting the game.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is:
- To explore humanâ€“machine interaction through non-traditional interfaces.
- To create interactive and fun embedded system for the boring old game of Tic-Tac-Toe played by everyone during classes.
- To try an unique way of choosing the desired cell. No basic buttons, no Playstation type joysticks from 2003...DISTANCE SENSORS & BARE HANDS.

## 3. Architecture

The system has the following layers:
- **Input Layer**:
  - 2x/3x Ultrasonic distance sensors (for selecting grid positions using finger)
  - 2x Push-buttons (confirm, reset, etc.)
- **Processing Layer**:
  - Raspberry Pi Pico 2W
  - Game logic engine written in Rust
- **Output Layer**:
  - 4x MAX7219-controlled 8x8 LED matrices
  - 1x Passive buzzer for sound feedback

Communication is done using:

| Component           | Interface | Connection Notes                |
|---------------------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| LED Matrix (4x)     | SPI       | DIN, CLK, CS to SPI bus         |
| Ultrasonic Sensors  | GPIO      | Each sensor uses TRIG + ECHO    |
| Buzzer              | GPIO      | Simple digital on/off control   |
| Push Buttons        | GPIO      | Connected to GPIO with pull-ups |

## Hardware

The Raspberry Pi Pico 2W is the central microcontroller for the Contactless Tic-Tac-Toe Game. With its dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor, Wi-Fi capability, and abundant GPIO pins, it provides all the required interfacing power to run the system efficiently.

It reads input from three HC-SR04P ultrasonic sensors to detect hand proximity, allowing players to choose the row and column of the cell without touching anything. The 4x MAX7219 8x8 LED Matrix modules are chained together to form a large 16x16 display grid, visually representing the game board in real time. Two tactile push buttons are used to confirm actions and reset the game. A passive buzzer generates sound effects, enhancing user feedback and engagement.
