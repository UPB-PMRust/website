## Description

This project combines the nostalgic feel of classic jukeboxes with a curated playlist of Romanian pop music from the 2000s. Users insert a coin to unlock playback; track information (title, artist, duration, release year) is shown on an OLED display. Physical buttons allow play/pause, previous/next and volume control.

## Motivation

At every party I attend, Romanian hits from the 2000s always come on—and I love that era’s pop sound. I’ve also always been fascinated by the jukeboxes featured in movies. Merging these two ideas into a single device seemed like a fun, tangible way to share my favorite decade of music with friends.

## Architecture

![Schematic diagram](schematic.webp)

  **Microcontroller Raspberry Pi Pico 2W** runs embedded Rust firmware, coordinating all peripherals.
  - **Tasks**:
	- Handles peripheral I/O (SPI, I²C, GPIO, PWM)
	- Manages shuffle queue and metadata parsing
	- Debounces buttons & validates coin input

 **OLED Display** shows metadata over I2C (song title, artist name, duration).

 **Tactile Buttons** read GPIO inputs for user controls.

 **Coin Validator Sensor** detects insertion of a valid coin/token and signals the microcontroller to unlock playback for one track.

 **Audio Amplifier + Speaker** decodes MP3 through I2S and drives speaker via PWM.

 **SD Card Module** stores MP3 files; accessed over SPI.

## Log

### Week 5 - 11 May

All components arrived and I started working on basic test codes to make sure everything is in working condition.
I managed to do the sensor and the display this week.

### Week 12 - 18 May

I managed basic reading from the SD card and sending audio output to a speaker, then I started working on making all the components interact with one another and work at the same time. Lastly, I added the buttons.

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

The entire system is built around a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W running embedded Rust, which reads .WAV files off a microSD card, drives a compact SSD1306 OLED screen for track info, and monitors both tactile buttons and a coin‐validator sensor for user input. Audio is streamed to an amplifier and speaker, while everything is powered from a laptop and prototyped on a breadboard for easy iteration.
