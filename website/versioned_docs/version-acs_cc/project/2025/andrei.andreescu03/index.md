## Description

This project is about building a simple automated turret that can detect and follow people with a camera and aim a laser at them in real-time. The user will be able to set a target (for example a red circle or a yellow t-shirt), and the turret will lock onto it and track it.



## Motivation

I got the idea from the game *Rust*, where you can build autoturrets that shoot at players who get too close to your base. I thought it would be cool to try and make something similar in real life, but just using a laser for now.

## Architecture 

The system has two main parts:

- **Vision + Targeting (Python)**: A Python script runs object detection (YOLO) on a laptop and identifies the target based on color or shape. It sends coordinates to the turret controller.
- **Control (Rust)**: A Raspberry Pi 2W runs a Rust program that controls two servo motors — one for horizontal rotation, one for vertical — and points the camera and laser to track the target.
- The camera and laser are mounted on the same platform, so they move together.

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 5 - 11 May
Researched similar turret systems for inspiration and finalized the design plan. Ordered all necessary hardware components based on system requirements and constraints.

### Week 12 - 18 May
Received the components and assembled the mechanical structure, including the servo mounts, camera bracket, and laser holder. Verified that all parts fit together and are functional.

### Week 19 - 25 May
Implemented the full software system. The Rust side uses Embassy for async servo control and joystick input, while Python handles vision using OpenCV and MediaPipe. Communication between the two is done over USB serial for real-time turret tracking.

## Hardware

A list of the main hardware components used in the project:

- **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W** – Acts as the main controller for servo movement and USB communication.
- **2x SG90 Servo Motors** – Control the pan and tilt movement of the turret.
- **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** – Measures the distance to nearby obstacles for HUD and behavior decisions.
- **Analog Joystick Module** – Used for manual control of turret direction
- **USB Camera** – Captures video feed for real-time object detection.
- **Laser Pointer** – Visually highlights the target being tracked.
- **Breadboard + Jumper Wires** – For quick and modular connections.
- **5V Power Supply** – Powers the servo motors reliably.
