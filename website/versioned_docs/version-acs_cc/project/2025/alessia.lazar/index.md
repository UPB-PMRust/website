## Description

The project involves an automatic pet feeder.
At fixed times (9:00 AM, 12:00 PM, and 7:00 PM), it will refill the food bowls, but not with a fixed amount each time. A sensor will calculate how much the pet has eaten from the bowl and will dispense the remaining amount needed to fill it. The same process applies to kibble and water.
Each week, the feeder will provide specific statistics regarding the quantities consumed by the pet.

To alert the owner when the containers need to be refilled, there will be two LEDs: green means there is enough food in the containers, red indicates they need to be refilled.
There will also be a buzzer that emits three signals at mealtime to notify the pet that the bowls have been refilled.

## Motivation

I chose this project because of my love for animals and the desire to simplify the feeding process on busy days. If the owner has a full day or is away from home all day, the pet will still have enough food, in moderate amounts throughout the day. This way, the feeding process becomes automated and easier to manage in everyday life.

## Hardware

Pico 2W – control board for the feeder

Servo motor – operates the flap for dispensing kibble

Water pump – fills the water container

Level sensor – measures the water level in the container

Pressure sensor – measures the total weight of dry food

Instrumentation module HX711 – converts the pressure sensor data to control the motor

Buzzer – audio signal

LEDs – reservoir level indicators
