## Description
CrateDigger is a portable sampler built around a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 and programmed using the Embassy framework in Rust. The device allows users to sample audio, playback predefined samples, and perform beat-making using a 16-step sequencer. It features a user interface with tactile buttons, a TFT screen with animations, and high-quality audio output via DAC and an integrated speaker. Ideal for music producers looking for a portable sampler/sequencer.

## Motivation
I have always been passionate about music and beat-making equipment. When the opportunity to pick this project came up, I knew it was the perfect opportunity to blend the two things I'm passionate about. 
My goal is to create a compact, DIY sampler and sequencer that allows musicians and hobbyists to experiment with sounds, create beats, and take their creativity anywhere.  
This project is not only a technical challenge but also a personal mission to create a fun tool that I might use in the future.

### Display (ST7735R)

**Interface:** SPI  
**Connections:**  
- SDA (Data Line) connected to Raspberry Pi Pico 2 SPI pins  
- SCL (Clock Line) connected to Raspberry Pi Pico 2 SPI pins

**Role:** Displays user interface, sequencing steps and device status.

---

### Buttons

**Interface:** GPIO 
**Connections:**  
- Connected to GPIO pins for controls (playback, recording, navigation, sequencing)

**Role:** Allows user input for sampling, playback, sequence control, and settings.

---

### Micro SD Card Module

**Interface:** SPI  
**Connections:**  
- SCK (Serial Clock) connected to Pico SPI pin  
- MOSI (Master Out Slave In) connected to Pico SPI pin  
- MISO (Master In Slave Out) connected to Pico SPI pin  
- CS (Chip Select) connected to Pico GPIO pin

**Role:** Stores audio samples, sequences, presets, and configuration data.

---

### DAC (MAX98357A)

**Interface:** I2S  
**Connections:**  
- Connected via I2S interface pins on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2

**Role:** Converts digital audio signals to high-quality analog audio for speaker output.

---

### Output (Speaker)

**Role:** Outputs audio signal from the DAC to provide sound playback.
