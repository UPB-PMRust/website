## Description

Thermometer that uses a LCD screen to show either room temperature or outside weather. Features:
- Room temperature measuring and display using BMP280 sensor
- Outside weather display using API calls through WIFI connection
- High resolution RGB screen
- Integrated touchscreen for ease of use
- USB module for temperature logging

## Motivation

I usually like to check the outside weather when going out to find out what I should wear. This means opening my phone and waiting for the weather app to refresh every time I want to get dressed. For the project assignment, I wanted to do something practical that I could use in my day to day life, and having a screen that tells me the temperature directly any time I need it is useful to me. I also haven't bought a thermometer for my room yet, another reason to build one for myself.

## Architecture 

![Architecture](./images/architecture.drawio.svg)

- **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W**
    - Central processing unit for all the other components
- **LCD Display with Touchscreen**
    - Used for weather/temperature display
    - Input/Output interface for changing display settings, connecting to WIFI, selecting weather locations etc.
- **BMP280 sensor**
    - Measures local temperature
- **USB Module**
    - The user can supply a storage unit over USB to log and display recorded data
- **LED Button**
    - Push button that acts as a ON/OFF switch for the device

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 5 - 11 May

Bought all the required components, made research and tested the Pico and basic WIFI functionality.

### Week 12 - 18 May

Wired all the components and made sure they work as expected.

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

- **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W:** the microcontroller
- **3.5'' LCD Module with Touchscreen:** display used for I/O
- **USB CH376S Module:** used for storing recorded temperature values
