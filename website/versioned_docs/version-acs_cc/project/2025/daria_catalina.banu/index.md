## Description

A system that follows the most intense light source using photoresistors and rotates and translates vertically a mini-solar panel to maximize light capture. 

## Motivation

I chose this project because it allows me to explore embedded systems through a practical application that combines environmental awareness with precise motion control. Using stepper motors to orient a solar panel towards the most intense light source offers both a technical challenge and an opportunity to improve energy efficiency. This project also gives me hands-on experience with ADCs, real-time light tracking, and low-level motor control using Rust and the Embassy framework.

- Light Sensor Module (ADC Sampling + Filtering)
Continuously reads values from 4 photoresistors (via ADC), applies a basic smoothing/filtering algorithm, and computes which direction has the strongest light intensity.

- Motor Control Module
Controls two stepper motors for horizontal and vertical movement. Uses a state machine to determine the required movement based on the output of the light sensor module.

- Tracking Algorithm
Coordinates input from the sensors and sends precise motor commands. Includes logic for tolerance thresholds, and movement limits.

- Display Module
Shows real-time status info (e.g., direction, light levels, current position) on the LCD2004 screen using pcf8754T module and i2c-characther-display crate

- Debug & Logging (defmt)
All internal states, sensor readings, and motor steps are logged via RTT for debugging and tuning purposes.

<!-- write your progress here every week -->
### Week 21 – 27 April 
Ordered hardware components updated the project's initial diagram, and also started exploring some rust crates compatible with my components.(uln2003, ads1x1x)
### Week 28 April – 4 May 
I tested some of the components on the breadboard to see if they work properly. (ky-018 photoresistor module, ads1115 adc convertor). I am also thinking of using a port expansion module for the led band, in case i run out of gpios on the pico.
### Week 5 - 11 May
Assembled everything on the breadboard using screws and also built a wooden support for the pannel, the breadboard , accumulator , solar pannel and the 4 photoresistor modules. I decided to use a transmission belt and a pulley for the vertical rotation stepper, since i didn't find the necessary pieces to attach the stepper directly to the bottom of the horizontal plane. Wrote code to test the steppers, lcd and ads.
### Week 12 - 18 May
I started using a power supply for breadboard module which can provide 5V or 3v3 depending on how I want to configure it. I actually measured the output and apparently it gives around 6V and 4V respectively. I might have accidentally burned the ADS when I connected it to the 5v power rail on the breadboard , because it kept outputting negative values, and as an emergency solution I decied to move 3 photoresistor modules back on the pico and keep only one on the ads. I replaced the old ads with a new one and it seems to work now. I still need to figure out a better approach to detect light fluctuations.

### Week 19 - 25 May

Implemented the full code , I decided to compute the averages on each analog channel then again average left, right, top bottom, choose minimum and rotate towards it. Calculated a threshold value expermientally, but it can be changed if need be. Sadly due to steppers being steppers and the way I designed the pannel support I decided to implement limitations for movement to not destroy the solar pannel or other hw components placed in the proximity. Also I had to fixate with screws the supporting tube because the transmission belt kept loosing momentum due to this tube's lack of proper fixation on the wooden support. I also added a few leds for fun. The voltmeter only outputs if there is enough light for the pannel to produce 4 V , i think i wasted my money on it :( .
## Hardware

- **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W** – The main microcontroller that runs the firmware using Rust and the Embassy async framework.

- **Raspberry Pi Pico Debug Probe**

- **4× Light Sensors + ADS1115 ADC** – Used to sense light intensity from different directions. The ADS1115 allows me to read data from the 4 modules

- **2× Stepper Motors (28BYJ-48) + ULN2003 Drivers** – Control the rotation and tilt of the solar panel. Each motor is driven by a ULN2003 driver module.

- **LCD2004 Display** – Displays real-time tracking information. Controlled using the hd44780-driver crate over I²C.

- **Battery Level Display Module** 

- **Accumulator**

- **Mini Solar Panel** – Rotates to face the brightest light source. Mounted on the motor platform.

- **Transmission Belt** – Used to rotate horizontally the solar pannel support.

- **6mm 15 Tooth Pulley**

- **Breadboard, jumper wires, resistors** – For prototyping and building the circuit.
