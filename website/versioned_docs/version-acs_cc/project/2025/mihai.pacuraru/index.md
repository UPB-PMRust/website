## Description

The "Plant Watering Alarm" is a smart monitoring system that detects when your plants need water and alerts you before they become dehydrated. The system uses a soil moisture sensor inserted into the plant's soil to continuously measure moisture levels. When the soil becomes too dry (falling below a configurable threshold), the system triggers an audio and visual alarm to notify you that your plant needs attention.

The core components include a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W microcontroller, soil moisture sensors, a buzzer for audible alerts and a RGB LED that shows the watering level:
- green (normal)
- yellow (prepare for watering)
- red (urgent watering)


## Motivation

I had a plant that i've forgot to water and died.
