## Description

This project implements a wireless guitar transmitter based on two Raspberry Pi Pico 2W boards, enabling basic audio transmission over Wi-Fi from a guitar to an amplifier. Additionally, the system applies simple real-time audio effects using software processing: **mute**, **tremolo**, and **clipping**.

## Motivation

I am passionate about guitar, and I wanted to see if it is possible to create a basic wireless transmitter using low-cost components. Through this project, I am exploring how can I interact with real-time audio while also making my first steps in the world of embedded systems.

## Architecture 

- **Transmitter (Pico 1)**:
  - Audio input from electric guitar (6.35 mm jack)
  - Signal filtering using capacitors
  - Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC)
  - Apply software audio effects (tremolo, mute, clipping)
  - Transmit data via Wi-Fi (UDP)

- **Receiver (Pico 2)**:
  - Receive audio data over Wi-Fi
  - Digital-to-Analog Conversion using MCP4725 DAC (I2C)
  - Signal filtering using capacitors
  - Output to amplifier

- **Effect Control**:
  - 3 buttons to switch between effects
  - 3 LEDs indicating the selected effect

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 28 Apr - 4 May
- Started the documentation for the project, cloned the repository and created the KiCad schematic for the transmitter and receiver, which I'll probably
modify later.

### Week 12 - 18 May
- Completed the schematic for the transmitter and receiver, including all the components needed for the project. Built the hardware and tested some
  basic functionalities, such as the ADC and DAC.

### Week 19 - 25 May
