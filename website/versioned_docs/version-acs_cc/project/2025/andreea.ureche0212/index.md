## Description
<!-- Describe in a few words your project idea. -->
This project consists of building a smoke detector using a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W. The device detects the presence of smoke and notifies the user via email. A visual indicator (LED strip), a buzzer, and a fan are also included to provide immediate feedback and ventilation. The alarm can be turned off by entering a verification code received through email on a keyboard module.


## Motivation

<!-- Why did you choose this project? -->
The project was chosen to address the need for affordable, customizable, and connected safety systems for smoke detection. It aims to provide a cost-effective, open-source alternative that not only detects smoke but also alerts users in real time via email, allowing for faster reaction in emergency situations.
From a learning perspective, this project also provides an opportunity for me to lear and deepen my understanding of embedded systems and to gain practical experience with Rust programming in a real-world context.
Overall, this is both a learning journey and a way to build something useful.

## Architecture

<!-- Add here the schematics with the architecture of your project. Make sure to include:
what are the main components (architecture components, not hardware components)
how they connect with each other -->
The architecture consists of the following main components:

- **Sensor Module**: Smoke detection using MH MQ-2 sensor.
- **Microcontroller**: Raspberry Pi Pico 2W acts as the main controller.
- **Network Stack**: Provides email notifications via SMTP over WiFi.
- **User Interface**: 3x4 Keyboard module for disabling the alarm with code verification.
- **Feedback Systems**:
  - WS2812 RGB LED strip for smoke level indication.
  - Buzzer for audible alert.
  - L293D H-Bridge Motor Driver because the board isn't powerful enough alone to power a motor 
  - DC Motor with fan for smoke evacuation.
  - LCD to provide an interface for displaying information.

## Hardware 

<!-- Detail in a few words the hardware used. -->
The smoke detector system is built around the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W, a Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller that serves as the core of the project. 
To detect the presence of smoke, the project uses an MH MQ-2 gas sensor, which provides analog readings corresponding to the level of smoke in the air. These readings are processed by the Pico through its ADC (analog-to-digital converter), and if a dangerous threshold is crossed, an alert is initiated.
As part of the feedback mechanism, the system includes a WS2812 RGB LED Bar, which visually indicates the current smoke level using different color patterns.
Additionally, a buzzer is used to provide a loud audio alert when smoke is detected. It is connected via a PWM-capable GPIO pin for tone control.
For active smoke evacuation, a small DC motor with propeller (fan) is activated during high smoke levels. I also used a L293D H-Bridge Motor Driver between the MCU and the motor that enables a voltage to be applied across a load in opposite direction as the MCU isn't powerful enough alone to power the DC motor.
User interaction is facilitated by a 3x4 keyboard module, which allows users to input a verification code received by email to stop the alert. 
A 1602 LCD is also included in the system to display useful information when smoke is detected and to enter the code provided.
