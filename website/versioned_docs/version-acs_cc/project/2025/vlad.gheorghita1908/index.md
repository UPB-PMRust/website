## Description

A custom USB MIDI controller built using a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W and tactile switches to detect and transmit MIDI signals (Note On/Off + Velocity) to a DAW using the USB MIDI protocol.

## Motivation

As someone passionate about composing music and making beats, I've always been curious about how physical MIDI instruments work under the hood. Instead of buying an off-the-shelf MIDI controller, I decided to build one myself to combine my love for music with my skills in electronics and programming. This project allows me to deepen my understanding of how musical interfaces communicate with digital audio workstations and explore creative, cost-effective solutions for real-world problems.

## Hardware

The DIY MIDI controller is built around the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W, with custom-designed circuitry implemented on homemade PCB boards. All components are connected using solid-core wires stripped from a UTP (Ethernet) cable, ensuring reliable point-to-point wiring across the board.

The controller features 12 keys, each equipped with two tactile switches mounted at different elevations. This physical arrangement enables velocity sensitivity by measuring the time interval between the activation of the first and second switches. In total, 24 switches are scanned.

To efficiently read these switches using minimal GPIOs, a 16-channel analog multiplexer is used (12 channels active). Each switch is wired into a voltage divider, producing distinct analog voltage levels depending on press state:
- more than 2650: no press (send Note OFF)
- between 2000–2500: one pressed (start timer)
- less than 1000: both pressed (stop timer, compute velocity, send Note ON)

The multiplexer’s selector lines are controlled via four GPIOs, while the SIG pin is connected to an ADC input on the Pico. Each key is scanned sequentially in a loop, with debouncing and averaging applied.

A potentiometer is connected directly to another ADC pin, providing continuous control input which is mapped to a MIDI filter parameter (e.g., cutoff frequency). Its value is read periodically and translated into MIDI Control Change (CC) messages.

For user interaction, the controller includes:
- An SSD1306 OLED display, driven via I2C, used to render a menu interface for settings such as octave selection and filter CC channel.
- Four momentary buttons connected to GPIOs:
    - Menu: enter/exit menu mode
    - Select: short/long presses toggle modes or confirm selections
    - Up/Down: navigate between options

The menu uses a carousel-style interface, offering intuitive cycling through options with feedback on the screen.

### Schematics

## Software

The firmware for the MIDI controller is written in Rust, using the embassy async runtime for embedded systems. It targets the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W (RP2040) microcontroller and uses the following major components:
1. Note Detection with Velocity \
Reads from the buttons under each key via analog multiplexer. Measures time between two switch presses for each key to estimate velocity and sends MIDI note-on events accordingly.
2. Filter Control via Potentiometer \
Continuously samples the potentiometer and sends MIDI CC messages on a user-configurable channel (70–79) if the value has changed significantly.
3. User Menu System via Button Interface & OLED Display \
Uses four buttons (Menu, Select, Up, Down) and an I2C SSD1306 OLED screen to:
    - Select between Octave and Filter modes.
    - Modify current octave (C0–C9).
    - Modify the active MIDI filter channel.
4. USB MIDI Output \
Implements a class-compliant USB MIDI device that sends:
    - Note on/off messages.
    - Control Change messages for the filter.
