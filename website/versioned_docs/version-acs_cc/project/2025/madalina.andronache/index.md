## Description

This project enables the user to input text using a 4x4 matrix keypad, which is then converted into Morse code and transmitted through:

+ **Sound signals** using a buzzer.
+ **Light signals** using LEDs.
+ **Visual display** on an LCD screen, where dots and dashes represent Morse code.

Ultimately, the aim is to integrate all components inside a compact system.

## Motivation

This project was chosen because it combines both hardware and software aspects in a manageable way. Developing a text-to-Morse converter offers an opportunity to better understand:
- GPIO management
- Embedded Rust programming
- Hardware-software interactions

It allows practicing embedded programming without requiring complex electronics knowledge.

## Architecture 

The following diagram shows the system architecture:

![System Architecture Diagram](./diagram.svg)

The **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W** acts as the brain of the system, coordinating all interactions between input and output components.

- The **4x4 matrix keypad** provides the user input.
- The **Pico** processes the text and converts it into Morse code.
- The **LEDs** and **buzzer** output the corresponding Morse signals.
- The **LCD screen** displays the Morse code in real time using dots (.) and dashes (_).

## Log

### Week 28 - 4 May

Initially, I encountered problems connecting the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W to the debugger.  

**Problem**: Using jumper wires for the SWD connection resulted in an **unstable link** between the Pico and the debugger, causing random disconnections and flashing failures due to loose connections.

**Solution**: I soldered stable male pins onto the Pico board and also reinforced the jumper cable connections by using more secure, stable headers, preventing movement and improving overall connection stability during debugging.

After stabilizing the programming connection, I focused on testing each hardware component individually to understand their behavior and determine the necessary Rust crates for the project.  
This phase involved experimenting with:

- Raspberry Pi Pico 2W setup,
- 4x4 matrix keypad integration,
- LEDs and buzzer control,
- LCD 1602 screen functionality.

While working with the LCD 1602, I initially encountered display issues.  

**Problem**: The display showed no visible characters, and I suspected a software communication error (wrong crate usage or I2C misconfiguration).

**Solution**: After careful troubleshooting, I discovered that the issue was actually **hardware-related**: the **contrast potentiometer** on the back of the LCD module needed adjustment.  

Once the potentiometer was properly tuned, the LCD correctly displayed characters.

During LED testing, another issue occurred.  

**Problem**: I accidentally burned two LEDs. The initially purchased red LEDs were rated for **2.1V–2.4V forward voltage**, but I mistakenly powered them directly without using an appropriate resistor, which led to their failure.

**Solution**: This helped me realize the importance of properly calculating and setting up voltage/current protection for LEDs.

In parallel with the hardware experiments, I also started writing the initial documentation for the project. I structured the project description, architecture, hardware and software components sections, and started outlining the weekly activity logs.


### Week 5 - 11 May

I again encountered issues with the connection between the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W and the debugger.  

**Problem**: The thin jumper wires used initially were unreliable and caused occasional flashing failures or disconnections during programming — this was mainly due to **transporting the project between home and university**, which led to unstable mechanical connections.

**Solution**: I replaced them with **thicker, high-quality cables**, which provided much better physical contact and stability. This resolved all connection issues.

In parallel, I finalized the **pin mapping** between the Pico board and each component (keypad, LCD, LEDs, and buzzer), ensuring proper physical layout and consistency for both coding and schematic design.

### Week 12 - 18 May

I wrote a minimal Rust test program to verify that all hardware components were correctly connected and functional.

While working with LEDs, I re-evaluated the need for current-limiting resistors.

Problem: Although I had already burned two LEDs earlier, I realized that even if the GPIO pins seem to work, long-term use without protection may damage the Pico board.

Solution: I add resistors in series with each LED, and update the schematic accordingly.

I also worked in KiCad, continuing the design of the schematic. I included headers for all external modules (keypad, LCD, buzzer, LEDs), and clearly labeled all connections between components and the microcontroller. I ensured that each symbol had the correct electrical type (Input/Output/Power) and verified the pin orientation for modules like the keypad and LCD.

In addition, I had to go shopping for a suitable enclosure to house the final version of the project.
