## Description

This project implements a security system where a continuous laser beam is emitted toward a photo-sensor. If the beam is interrupted, the system sounds an alarm and pushes a notification to the user’s phone via the Pico W’s Wi-Fi module. A manual button allows arming and disarming the system. The most recent intrusions will be stored in a database with their timestamps

## Motivation

The goal of the project is to develop an affordable and easy-to-implement security solution using low-cost components and the Raspberry Pi Pico W platform, which provides integrated Wi‑Fi connectivity for real-time notifications.

## Architecture

The system is divided into four logical modules:

1. **Laser Module** (emitter + sensor)  
2. **Control Unit** (Raspberry Pi Pico W firmware)  
3. **User Interface** (buzzer + push-button)  
4. **Network Service** (cloud notification endpoint)

## Log

### Week 5 - 11 May

I got started with the Pico setup and became accustomed to wiring the components to the board itself. I ran into difficulties connecting the debugger Pico, so I activated USB logging for my development needs. 

I started writing the main logic of the program. I tested each component individually through code and then built a broader program that encapsulates the LDR reading and buzzer trigger.

### Week 12 - 18 May

I assembled most of the pieces and further developed the logic for the laser–LDR calibration period. I also began developing the Wi-Fi setup and email-sending feature.

## Hardware

We use off-the-shelf components mounted on a breadboard and powered by a 5 V supply. The main utilities are the button, the passive buzzer which will be configured to emit a custom tune, the laser which will just be controlled by the button and the photoresistor which checks the laser output.
