## Description

The project is similar to a PlayStation or an Xbox. It has:
 - a console that runs a game by itself and displays it on a screen
 - a controller with buttons that runs separate from the console and transmits user input through WiFi

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to explore the fundamental principles of gaming systems by building a simplified, custom console-controller setup using the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W. By separating the console and controller and connecting them via WiFi, the project mimics real-world designs like PlayStation and Xbox, offering insights into wireless communication, embedded systems and real-time game processing. It also provides an opportunity to develop practical skills in hardware integration and also 3D modeling for building the plastic cases of the 2 components.

## Architecture

The system architecture consists of two main components: the Console and the Controller.

 - The Console includes the Raspberry Pi Pico W running the game logic, rendering 2D graphics (such as a Snake-like game) on an attached LCD display.

 - The Controller is a separate device, also based on a Raspberry Pi Pico W, equipped with tactile buttons to capture user inputs.

 - Communication between the Controller and the Console happens over WiFi. The Controller sends input data, and the Console processes it to update the game state and display it accordingly.

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 5 - 11 May
Started the project by setting up the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W and the LCD display. I managed to display a simple "Hello World" message on the screen. I also started working on the controller, connecting the buttons and testing their functionality.

### Week 12 - 18 May
I finished the whole harware setup, including drawing power from the 9V batteries. I also managed to send button presses from the controller to the console over WiFi. The console receives the input and displays the pressed button on the screen.

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

The project uses the following hardware components:

#### Console:
 - Raspberry Pi Pico 2W
 - 2.4 inch LCD IPS Display 240x320
 - DC-DC Step Down Module
 - 9V Battery Support
 - 9V Battery
 - Breadboard, Required wiring and connectors
 - Plastic Case (3D printed)

#### Controller:
 - Raspberry Pi Pico 2W
 - Tactile Buttons
 - 9V Battery Support
 - 9V Battery
 - Breadboard, Required wiring and connectors
 - Plastic Case (3D printed)
