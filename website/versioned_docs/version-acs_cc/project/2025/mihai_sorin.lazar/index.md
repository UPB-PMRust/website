## Description

Modern elevators can waste time and energy by stopping at unnecessary floors or responding inefficiently to requests. This project introduces a smarter elevator that processes requests in real time, prioritizing efficient travel and reducing both wait times and energy consumption.

## Motivation
I chose this project because it addresses a real-world need for smarter, more efficient building systems. Elevators are critical for accessibility and convenience, and optimizing their operation can have a significant impact on energy use and user experience. This project combines my interest in automation and control with the challenge of creating a practical solution that benefits everyday life.

## Architecture

## Main Components

### üü¶ Input Module: Floor Request Buttons
- **Function:** Simulate user requests for specific floors.
- **Details:** Each button is wired to a GPIO input on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W.

### üü™ Controller Module: Raspberry Pi Pico 2W
- **Function:** Central brain that processes button inputs, manages the elevator request queue, determines optimal direction, and issues movement commands.
- **Features:** Real-time scheduling, efficient route planning, and queue management logic.

### üüß Output Module: Stepper Motor & Floor Indicators
- **Stepper Motor:** Simulates elevator movement between floors, controlled via the A4988 driver.
- **LED Indicators:** Display the current elevator floor and travel direction.
