## Description

The project is a smart recycling bin for waste, which automatically sorts an object based on the material it is made of. A camera will take a picture of the waste, which will be analyzed using AI and the result will determine the compartment into which the bin will automatically dispose of the waste.

## Motivation

I always wondered what is the best method to sort waste as the public bins are still too generic when it comes to sorting trash by material. This idea was firstly explored in a hackathon but because of the insufficient time was only a proof of concept, now wanting to make it real.

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 5 - 11 May

Defining the concept of the project and the list of components.
Ideating the general design of the bin.
Order of the components and compatiblity check.

### Week 12 - 18 May

Started the assembly and wiring of the components.
Compatiblity problems and new order for camera.
(The current camera module will be replaced.)
Testing the assembled components.

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

### Raspberry Pi Pico W (Pico 2W)

Central controller for all peripherals, used for:

Wi-Fi: To communicate with the PC running the AI classifier.

GPIO: To control servos, camera trigger, LED, and read sensor input.

I²C: To communicate with the LED display.

Power Supply: Via USB (5V), also powers other 3.3V components via onboard regulator.

### OV7670 Camera Module

Captures an image of the object placed in the bin, connected via SPI (via PIO or a dedicated SPI interface on Pico).

### LED

Provides lighting for consistent image capture, connected to a GPIO pin via a current-limiting resistor.

It is turned ON/OFF by the Pico before/after taking a photo.

### LED Display

Displays the material type detected (e.g., “Plastic”) and is connected through I²C.

Power: 3.3V or 5V depending on display model.

### IR Proximity Sensor

Detects when an object is placed for analysis.

Power: 3.3V or 5V depending on sensor.

Connection:

VCC → 3.3V or 5V.

GND → GND.

OUT → GPIO pin on Pico.

### SG90 Servo Motors

Move trays to direct waste into one of the four compartments, controlled with PWM.

### USB Cable & Laptop

Powers the bin through the USB port and the laptop will use AI
to analyze the data.
