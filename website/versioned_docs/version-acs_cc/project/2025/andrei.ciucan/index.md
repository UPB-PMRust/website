## Description

Smart Light Piano is a **mini digital piano** based on a **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W**.  
It allows the player to interact with eight physical keys, triggering musical notes generated via PWM on a **5V passive buzzer**.  
The system integrates three LEDs for dynamic visual feedback:
- **Red LED**:  
  - Connected to the **photoresistor (LDR)**.
  - **Behavior**: As the environment gets darker, the red LED **brightens** proportionally; as ambient light increases, the red LED **dims** progressively.
- **Yellow LED**:  
  - **Triggered** when a button located at an **even position** (2, 4, 6, 8) is pressed.
  - **Purpose**: Highlights even-positioned key presses.
- **Green LED**:  
  - **Triggered** when a button located at an **odd position** (1, 3, 5, 7) is pressed.
  - **Purpose**: Highlights odd-positioned key presses.

The piano offers **three operating modes**, selected through two dedicated buttons:

| Mode Trigger | Mode Name | Description |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Button A pressed** | **Note Guess Mode** | A random note is played and the player must identify it by pressing the corresponding key. Each correct guess is stored and the sequence of correct notes is replayed as a melody after the first mistake. |
| **Button B pressed** | **Effects Mode** | Applies real-time audio effects (such as vibrato, tremolo, or frequency shifts) to the notes for a more dynamic sound experience. |
| **Button A pressed, then Button B pressed** | **Pressure-Controlled Pitch Mode (optional)** | An advanced mode where note pitch varies according to air pressure measurements from the **BMP280** sensor, allowing players to modify sounds by moving the device up or down. This mode is optional and intended to enrich the overall interaction. |
| **Button B pressed, then Button A pressed** | **Idle Mode** | If the system is already in a mode and the buttons are pressed in this order, the piano exits to the Idle state. |

>If, during testing, the BMP280 pressure readings do not provide a clear-enough delta when I move the piano up or down, the pitch‑modulation logic will seamlessly fall back to temperature‑based mapping from the same sensor.

> **Optional**: Although Wi-Fi connectivity was initially planned, I was not able to implement it due to electrical interference caused by the hardware configuration.
> As an alternative, I developed a workaround based on two scripts:
> - A Python script that runs the firmware via cargo run and parses RTT serial output to extract live values like pressure, mode, and notes.
> - A browser interface using Flask and Chart.js to display a real-time pressure graph and the current active mode of the system.


## Motivation

This project combines my passion for embedded systems, music and real-time hardware interaction.  
It involves reading analog and digital inputs, communicating with sensors over I²C, generating real-time audio signals and coordinating everything through asynchronous Rust programming.  
The result is a responsive system that seamlessly blends low-level hardware control with modern approaches to embedded software development.

## Architecture

The project has the following architecture:

- __Raspberry Pi Pico 2W:__ Handles the main logic of the project - reading piano key inputs, controlling the buzzer through PWM to generate musical notes, adjusting LED brightness based on the photoresistor (LDR) reading, handling mode selection through buttons and communicating with the BMP280 sensor over I²C.
- __Raspberry Pi Pico 2W (Debugger Controller):__  Dedicated to debugging and monitoring the operation of the first Pico.
- __Passive 5V Buzzer (via transistor):__ Controlled via PWM from the first Pico. Generates audible musical notes corresponding to key presses, with real-time modulation depending on the selected mode.
- __Piano Buttons (8 Buttons):__ Connected to the main Pico's GPIO pins. Each button corresponds to a musical note; pressing a button triggers sound generation.
- __Mode Selection Buttons (2 Buttons):__ Connected to separate GPIO pins.  
  - Pressing Button A selects Note Guess Mode.  
  - Pressing Button B selects Effects Mode.  
  - Pressing both simultaneously activates Pressure-Controlled Pitch Mode.
- __Photoresistor (LDR) with Voltage Divider:__ Provides analog light measurements read by the ADC module of the main Pico. Controls the brightness behavior of the red LED depending on the ambient light level.
- __LED Indicators (Red, Yellow, Green):__ 
  - The **red LED** adjusts its brightness dynamically based on the ambient light measured by the LDR — brighter in darkness, dimmer in strong light.  
  - The **yellow LED** lights up when a piano key at an even position is pressed.  
  - The **green LED** lights up when a piano key at an odd position is pressed.
- __BMP280 Sensor:__   Connected to the main Pico via I²C. Provides real-time pressure and temperature data, used in Pressure-Controlled Pitch Mode to adjust the buzzer sound dynamically.
- __Power Source:__ Provides USB power to the primary Raspberry Pi Pico 2W, which in turn supplies power to the second Pico used for debugging, along with all the connected peripherals.
- __Breadboard__: Used to build and run the entire project without soldering. All components are connected directly using jumper wires for flexibility and ease of assembly.
- __Prototype Board (Optional)__: May be used later to solder the final version of the circuit for improved durability and long-term use.

## Log

### Week 23 - 30 April
I started working on the project documentation and set up the GitLab repository to manage the documentation separately. I created the first version of the system block diagram using diagrams.net, drafted the initial list of hardware and software components and began designing the hardware schematic in KiCad, covering the main modules. I also outlined the structure for the final `index.md` file.

### Week 5 - 11 May
Connected the two Raspberry Pi Pico 2W boards via UART (one for debugging, one as the main controller).  
Ran the `defmt` debugger on the first Pico to monitor real-time behavior.  
Fixed various hardware/software issues (wrong GPIO pins, button debounce).  
Connected and tested initial components: buttons, buzzer, and LEDs using basic Rust code.

### Week 12 - 18 May

I finished wiring all the hardware components on the breadboard, including LEDs, buttons, the buzzer, LDR and BMP280 sensor. I tested both a 3.3V and a 5V passive buzzer and the 5V version worked much better when powered through a transistor. All buttons and LEDs responded correctly in simple test programs and I was able to read analog values from the LDR and pressure data from the BMP280. I also added a 100 μF capacitor across the buzzer to reduce possible electrical noise. Despite that, the Wi-Fi stopped working whenever the hardware was connected, suggesting interference.

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

I am using two Raspberry Pi Pico 2W boards in this setup. The main Pico handles all piano functionalities (PWM audio output, button reading, LED brightness control via ADC and BMP280 communication over I²C), while the second Pico acts as a debug interface through UART.
To reduce high-frequency electrical noise caused by the buzzer’s PWM signal, a 100 μF electrolytic capacitor was added across its power lines. This was intended to stabilize the supply and reduce interference, especially during Wi-Fi-related testing.

## Software

The project firmware is written entirely in Rust, using an asynchronous multitasking model with Embassy libraries, running on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W. \
Four independent asynchronous tasks manage real-time behavior: 
- A mode control task that monitors the two mode selection buttons and configures the piano behavior accordingly. 
- A piano task that plays musical notes based on key presses, dynamically adapting to the active mode (Note Guess, Effects, Pressure-Controlled Pitch).
- An LDR task that adjusts the brightness of the red LED depending on ambient light measured by the photoresistor. 
- A BMP280 task that reads environmental data asynchronously via I²C, supporting optional dynamic pitch adjustment based on pressure.
### Detailed Design

The main software modules are:
Module | Functionality
|-----------------|---------|
Mode Control Task | Continuously monitors the two mode buttons. Depending on which button(s) are pressed, it updates a shared state variable that configures how the piano task operates: random note guessing, sound effects, or pressure-based pitch shifting.
Piano Task | Reads the 8 piano buttons. Generates different behaviors based on the current selected mode: normal tone playing, sound effects applied, or pitch dynamically influenced by atmospheric pressure.
LDR Task | Reads the photoresistor (LDR) values using ADC and adjusts the PWM duty cycle to smoothly control the brightness of the red LED.
BMP280 Task | Communicates with the BMP280 sensor over I²C to acquire temperature and pressure readings every second. Pressure values are used optionally to influence musical note characteristics when in Pressure-Controlled Mode.
PWM and GPIO Handling | PWM is used for buzzer sound modulation and LED brightness control. GPIO pins are used for button inputs with pull-up configurations and non-blocking reads.
Task Synchronization | Embassy's async framework ensures cooperative multitasking and real-time responsiveness without requiring threads or RTOS features.
