## Description

The Smart Desk Assistant is an embedded notification display and management system. The device fetches notifications from the server and displays them on an OLED screen. Users can delete notifications, which also removes them from the server. Timed notifications are supported as well, triggering an alarm when their timer expires.

## Motivation

I wanted a simple and useful device to help manage my tasks without being distracted by my laptop or phone. Also, seems like a good project to practice networking in embedded programming.


## Architecture

**Main components**:
- **Server**: Hosts the notifications and sends them on request.
- **Raspberry Pi Pico W 2**: Connects to the server over WiFi, manages notifications, updates the display, and handles button inputs.
- **OLED Display (SSD1306 I2C)**: Displays the notifications.
- **Buttons**: Navigate through and delete notifications.
- **Buzzer**: Alerts when timer notifications trigger.

**Connections**:
- WiFi connects the Pico W 2 to the Server.
- SPI connects Pico W 2 to the OLED Display.
- GPIOs connect Pico W 2 to the Buttons and Buzzer.
