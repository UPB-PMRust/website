## Description

A device that monitors the air quality in a house using multiple sensors and sends alerts to the user if the air quality is bad. The device will be connected to a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W and will use a display to show the data. 

The indexes that will be monitored are:
- **temperature**
- **humidity**
- **CO**
- **pressure**
- **noise**
- **ultraviolet radiation**
- **fine dust**
- **fire risk**

These indexes will be shown on the display and it will be used an MicroSD card to store the data to be able to show graphs of the data over time. The device will be connected to a Wi-Fi network and will send alerts to the user if the air quality is bad.

In case of bad air quality, the device will start a buzzer to alert the user, and in case of not being at home, the device will send a notification to the user using a server. 

Also, in case of high temperature or humidity, the device is able to turn on a fan to cool the room if the user sets this option.

The LCD display will be use to show the indexes in real time, but also graphs of the data over time. The indexes will be shown in different colors depending on the value of the index. For example, if the temperature is too high, the text will be red, if it is normal, it will be green and if it is too low, it will be blue. The same will be done for all the indexes.

## Motivation

I choose this project because it could have a real usage in my life. I am a person that is very careful about the air quality in my house and I want to be able to monitor it in real time. 

Also, I want to be able to see the data over time and be able to see if there are any changes in the air quality. I also want to be able to receive alerts if the air quality is bad, so I can take action and improve it. 

In this modern world we live in, where air pollution and climate change are becoming more and more of a problem, I want to be very careful about the air quality in my house and prevent any problems that might occur so my health is not affected.

## Architecture 

The **Rasperry Pi Pico 2W** will be the main microcontroller of the project. It will be connected to multiple sensors that will monitor the air quality in the house. 

The **sensors** will be connected to the microcontroller using I2C or SPI communication. The data from the sensors will be read by the microcontroller and will be displayed on the **LCD display**. This data will be stored on a MicroSD card to be able to show graphs of the data over time on the **LCD display**. The microcontroller will also be connected to a Wi-Fi network and will send alerts to the user if the air quality is bad. 

There will also be mechanisms to prevend the rise of the temperature and humidity in the house, like **a fan** that will be turned on automatically if the temperature or humidity is too high.

The device will also have a **buzzer** that will be used to alert the user if the air quality is bad. The buzzer will be turned on automatically if the air quality is bad (eg. if the CO level is too high, if a fire is detected, if dust is too high etc.).

For very high risk, like fire, high measurements of CO or very high temperature, the device will send a notification to the user using **a server** through the Wi-Fi network to alert him even if he is not at home.

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 5 - 11 May

In thss week I stuck the pins on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W microcontrollers and tried to test the debugger setup, but I had some issues because my debugger didn't see any target. So I had to buy another Raspberry Pi Pico 2W and I stuck the pins on it too. After that I tried to test the debugger setup again and it worked. 
The final thing I did in this week was to test the LCD display and I managed to make it work and display 'Hello World' on the screen.
For the LCD display I used the mipidisi driver with the SPI comunication to write data on the screen. I used the pin 18 for the CS pin, pin 16 for the DC pin and pin 17 for the reset pin. I used the SPI1 communication with the pins 10, 11 and 12 for the SCK, MOSI and MISO pins.

### Week 12 - 18 May

In this week I started to test the sensors and to write their data on the LCD display.

I started with the MQ-7 sensor and wrote the driver for it to get the CO PPM value and display it on the screen. I used ADC pin 26 to read the value and transform it to PPM. I displayed the value on the screen in dynamic colors depending on the value of the CO level:
- CO between 0 and 9 PPM - green
- CO between 9 and 29 PPM - yellow
- CO between 29 and 36 PPM - orange
- CO above 36 PPM - red

After this I connected the flame sensor and I wrote a driver for it to get the flame parcentage chance and display it on the screen. I used ADC pin 28 for the analog ping to calculate the flame percentage and I used the ping 22 for the digital pin to check if the flame is detected or not. I displayed the value on the screen in dynamic colors depending on the value of the flame percentage:
- If flame is detected by the digital pin, the text is red
- Flame percentage between 0 and 20% - green
- Flame percentage between 20 and 50% - yellow
- Flame percentage above 50% - orange

Then I connected the RTC DS3231 module and I used ds3231 driver to get the time and date and display it on the screen. I used I2C communication with the pins 20 and 21 for SDA and SCL pins. I noted that the datetime is inaccurate but I will fix it later, now is important that the RTC module is working and I can get the data from it successfully and the time passes correctly every second even though it is not the correct time and date.

I connected the BMP280 sensor and I used bmp280 driver to get the temperature and pressure values and display them on the screen. I used I2C communication with the pins 14 and 15 for SDA and SCL pins. I displayed the values on the screen in dynamic colors depending on the value of the temperature and pressure:
- Temperature between 0 and 15 degrees - blue
- Temperature between 15 and 30 degrees - green
- Temperature above 30 degrees - red
- Pressure between 0 and 990 hPa - blue
- Pressure between 990 and 1030 hPa - green
- Pressure above 1030 hPa - red

I connected the UV sensor and I used the ADC 27 pin and connected to a voltage of 3.3V to get the UV index value and display it on the screen. I categorized the UV index in 5 categories:
- UV index between 0 and 2 - LOW - green
- UV index between 2 and 5 - MODERATE - yellow
- UV index between 5 and 7 - HIGH - orange
- UV index between 7 and 10 - VERY HIGH - red
- UV index above 10 - EXTREME - purple

I connected the sound senor and I realised that this is a digiatal sensor, so it only has a digital pin that can be used to check if the sound is detected or not and has a potentiometer to set the sensitivity. So I decided to change the utility of this sensor because I wanted the display the sound level in dB. I will use this sensor to check if the sound is detected or not and if the sound is detected I will turn on my lights in the house. I used pin 13 for the digital pin.

I connected a buzzer to the pin 9 and wrote the code for it to turn on when a flame is detected or the CO level is too high (above 36 PPM). I set a higher frequency so the buzzer will be heard better. Also in this situation I will display a red text on the screen to alert the user.

I connected the mini fan to the pin 3 beause I used pwm on channel 1B and I wrote the code for it to turn on when the temperature is above 28 degrees. The fan will be turned on at 50% of the speed and it will increase the speed to 100% at 35 degrees. Also when the fan is turned on, I will display a green text on the screen to alert the user that the fan is turned on and the speed percentage.

I made some tests:
- I wanted to test the buzzer and I started a flame in front of the flame sensor and the buzzer started to beep and the text on the screen turned red.

![flame_detection](flame_detection.webp)

- I decreased the temperature threshold to 26 degrees to test the fan and I verified that the fan started to turn on and the text on the screen turned green.

![fan_starting](fan_starting.webp)

- I test the buzzer and the fan together to see how they will appear on the screen and I verified that the buzzer started to beep and the text on the screen turned red and green.

![flame_and_fan](flame_and_fan.webp)

These tests were before I displayed the time and date on the screen, so I will did the test again to see how the screen will look like with the time and date on it. I verified that the text is not overlapping:
