## Description

The project is an automatic cat feeder, capable of dispensing food portions according to a preset schedule. The user can set the feeding interval and the amount of food the pet should receive. Sensors will detect whether the cat has eaten, the amount of food available (and alert when it's empty), and the weight of the tray (to account for the food already present before dispensing more). Red LEDs will indicate when the food compartment is empty or if the humidity level is too high. An electronically controlled mechanism will handle food distribution. The system will also include a display showing information such as when the cat last ate, how much food it receives, and at what intervals.

## Motivation

Being a cat owner and having spoken with friends who own such devices, it was easy for me to identify the most important functionalities for a user, which helped me design and pitch the project.

## Architecture 

### Components
  
| Components | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| Dispensing mechanism | Dispenses the food into the cat bowl |
| Weighing scale | Measures the amount of food in the bowl |
| Info display | Displays info from the sensors |
| User input | Lets user change the food quantity and dispensing intervals |
| Food level sensor | Measures whether the container has any food |
| Humidity measurer | Measures the humidity of the container |
| Clock | Measures time |

### Interconnection
- The Food Level Sensor and Clock determine when the dispensing mechanism gets fired
- The User Input and Weighing Scale determine for how long the Dispensing Mechanism stays fired
- Info Display receives info about:
  - the amount of food the cat has eaten from the Weighing Scale
  - whether the food container is empty from the Food Level Sensor
  - the humidity level in the food container from the Humidity Measurer
  - the variables set by the user from User Input
