## Description

The project consists of an intelligent irrigation system for plants that constantly monitors three essential parameters for optimal irrigation:

**Soil humidity** - determines when plants need water \
**Reservoir level** - checks water availability for irrigation \
**Light intensity** - prevents irrigation during periods of strong light

When soil moisture drops below a preset threshold, the system checks if the reservoir contains enough water and if the light intensity is suitable. If all conditions are met, it automatically activates a mini-pump that irrigates the plants.
The system includes a display to show levels (low, medium, high) for the 3 parameters.

## Motivation

I chose to develop this automatic irrigation system because I wanted to solve a practical problem many plant owners face, that being the inconsistent watering due to busy schedules or forgetfulness. Second, this project allows me to apply embedded systems knowledge in a hands-on way, working with multiple sensors and including a display for easy reading of the parameters.

## Architecture

The main architectural components are:

 - **RTC Clock with Battery** - a clock that keeps the microcontroller sleeping, it wakes it at intervals of 10 minutes and completes 20 measurements for accuracy and then puts it back to sleep

 - **Humidity Sensor & Photoresistor & Float Sensor** - measures the soil humidity and if it is too low, the light is not too strong and there is water in the reservoir then the realy module starts the water pump and it waters the plant

 - **Display** - shows all the parameters and messages for the start of the process etc.

 - **Water Pump** - used to water the plant when necessary

## Log

### Week 5 - 11 May

- Connected the Hardware
- Tested the sensors

### Week 12 - 18 May

- Almost completed the final arangements (I decided I want to put it all in a bigger box, with the display on top of it)
- Updated the Bill Of Materials
- Did the Kicad schematic again with the now used pins of the MCU
- Added photos here of the hardware, that I will probably update again before the fair if something changes

### Week 19 - 25 May

- Completed the software implementation
- Completed the final design
- Finalized the documentation

## Hardware Design

### Sensors

* **Soil Hygrometer Humidity**: A precision resistive humidity sensor that measures soil moisture.

* **Photoresistor**: A light-dependent resistor that exhibits variable resistance inversely proportional to light intensity, enabling the system to monitor ambient light conditions for optimal plant growth.

* **Float Sensor**: A mechanical sensor triggers when water levels reach predefined thresholds, preventing both reservoir depletion and overflow conditions.

### Control and Timing Components

* **RTC (Real-Time Clock) Module**: Incorporates a DS3231 enabling programmed sleep cycles for the microcontrollers via interrupt-based wakeup, significantly reducing power consumption.

### Actuation

* **NPN Transistor**: A NPN Transistor that provides safe switching of the water pump circuit.

* **Water Pump**: A submersible pump capable of delivering appropriate water volume for plant irrigation.

### Display

* **ST7735 LCD Display**: A 1.8" TFT color display with SPI interface and embedded controller, providing visual representation of system status, sensor readings, and operational modes.
