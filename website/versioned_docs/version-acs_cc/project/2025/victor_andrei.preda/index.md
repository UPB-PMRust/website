##  Project Description  
This project resembles the traditional game of checkers, implemented as an online multiplayer experience. Players can move their pieces freely in all four diagonal directions (up-right, up-left, down-right, down-left) from the very first turn, adding strategic depth to every match.
- **6-button control system** per player:  
  - 4 directional buttons for movement  
  - 2 selection buttons to highlight valid pieces  
- **Dedicated LCD displays** showing the real-time game board  
- **Online multiplayer** support for competitive play 


## Motivation
As a fan of old-school strategy games, I’ve always loved the elegance of checkers—its simple rules hiding deep tactical possibilities. This project merges nostalgic gameplay with modern technology, which motivated my development approach.


## Architecture

![Arhitectura sistemului](images/Architecture.webp)

1. **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W** (x2)  
   - Interconnected  with all components 

2. **Buttons** (x6 per player)  
   - Connected to each Pico, acting as input (move piece/selection) 

3. **2.2" 240x320 px SPI LCD** (x1 per player)  
   - Connected through embedded-graphics at the microcontroller

4. **Wi-Fi**
   - Microcontrollers communicate with each other through it
   - Player 0 acts as the server; Player 1 acts as a client

5. **Embedded-Graphics**
   - Library that a microcontroller is using in order to display the game
   - Connects the microcontroller with the LCD


## Log

### Week 5 - 11 May
1. **Upload first state of documentation**

### Week 12 - 18 May
1. **Done making the hardware**
2. **Add images in documentation**
3. **Update documentation**

## Hardware

1. **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W** (x2)  
   - Acts as the main controller for each player's unit  
   - Connects all components and handles Wi-Fi communication  

2. **Buttons** (x6 per player)  
   - Connected to GPIO pins:  
     - GP8   
     - GP9 
     - GP12  
     - GP13  
     - GP14  
     - GP15
    - Used as input for selection/move piece 

3. **2.2" 240x320 px SPI LCD** (x1 per player)  
   - Connections:  
     - VCC → 3.3V  
     - GND → GND  
     - CS → GP18  
     - RESET → GP17  
     - DC/RS → GP16  
     - SDI/MOSI → GP11  
     - SCK → GP10  
     - LED → 3.3V  
     - SDO/MISO → N/C
   - Display table and pieces for each player 

4. **Resistors** (22kΩ, x6 per player)  
   - Connected between buttons and GPIO pins to ensure clean digital input signals
