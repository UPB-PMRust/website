## Description

Ultimate Tic Tac Toe is a variation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, composed of 9 games of classic Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 board. The game is a lot more complex than the classic variation, with each move determining where the other player is allowed to place their next symbol. When a player places a symbol into a case on the small board the other player is forced to place their symbol in the corresponding small board. When someone completes a small board it is replaced by a large symbol and no further moves are allowed in that board, with the game ending when one player has a line of large symbols.

## Motivation

The decision to implement this game was rather simple, as I always enjoyed playing the classic Tic Tac Toe, however it was too simple to code, so I decided to challange myself with the more complex variation, known as Ultimate Tic Tac Toe
