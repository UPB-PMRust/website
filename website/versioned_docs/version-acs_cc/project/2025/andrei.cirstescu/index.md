## Description

This project implements a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game on an RP2350 development board, using a 2.2" SPI TFT display for \
graphical output and a 4x4 button matrix for user input. Players interact with the game by selecting grid positions \
via the button matrix, while the display shows the game board, moves, and results in real time. The project will also \
include multiple variants to the Tic-Tac-Toe game: 
  * Misère Tic-Tac-Toe -> The goal is to not get 3 in a row.
  * Wild Tic-Tac-Toe -> Players can place either O or X.
  * Forgetful Tic-Tac-Toe -> Fourth-last moves are erased at each step.

## Motivation

This project was created to explore how simple games like Tic-Tac-Toe can be made more engaging through creative \
variants, while also providing a fun way to apply embedded programming skills and hardware integration. I decided upon \
this project because I was interested in working with a display in an embedded context, while also recreating a staple \
pen-and-paper game turned digital like Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Architecture 

![Block Diagram](architecture.webp)

- ### Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W
  * Central Microcontroller, manages button inputs and interfaces with the Display.
  * Connects directly to the Button Matrix and the TFT Display.
- ### 2.2" TFT SPI LCD Display(ILI9341)
  * Display to show the state of the game, as well as player scores and the game variant.
  * Interfaces with the Microcontroller through SPI.
- ### 4x4 Button Matrix
  * Handles inputs for X and O placements, game variant selection and restart.
- ### Passive Buzzer
  * Used to play different notes.
- ### LEDs
  * Two LEDs, green and red.
  * Lights up according to winner.
