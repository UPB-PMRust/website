## Description
The car is controlled by means of a virtual remote control simulated in a web app. It uses an IOE-SR05 Ultrasonic Sensor to display the distance between the car and obstacles and aims to create a virtual map inside the web app. 

## Motivation

Since I was in primary school, my favourite toys were remote-controlled cars, which I've collected for several years. This project combines my childhood passion with modern technology and aims to make a more interesting, cooler remote control car suitable for all ages!

## Architecture

1. **Web App**
   - Hosted by the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W using its onboard Wi-Fi.
   - Allows the user to control the car from a browser.
   - Sends control commands over Wi-Fi.

2. **Web Server (on Raspberry Pi Pico 2W)**
   - Receives user commands from the web app.
   - Runs Rust firmware to handle routing and control logic.
   - Acts as the central coordinator of the system.

3. **Motor Control Module**
   - Processes movement commands (forward, backward, turn).
   - Sends PWM and direction signals to the L298N motor driver.

4. **DC Motors with Gearbox and Wheels**
   - Receive power and control signals from the L298N module.
   - Convert electronic commands into physical motion.
   - Enable the robot to move.

5. **IOE-SR05 Ultrasonic Sensor (Sensor Module)**
   - Measures the distance to nearby objects.
   - Sends distance data to the Pico 2W via GPIO.
   - Used for basic room mapping.



###  Communication between components:

- The **web app** is hosted by the **Pico 2W** and accessed via Wi-Fi from a userâ€™s browser.
- The **web server** interprets commands and forwards them to the **motor control module**.
- The **motor control module** sends PWM and direction signals to the **L298N driver**.
- The **L298N driver** powers two **DC motors with gearboxes and wheels** to drive the vehicle.
- The **sensor module** sends distance readings to the Pico W to enable obstacle detection or mapping.



## Log

### Week 5 - 11 May

After establishing the final form of the project, I started my documentation by gathering information about the required hardware parts and necessary libraries. I configured the setup: I connected the Raspberry Pi Pico 1 for debugging to the target (Raspberry Pi Pico 2W) and used the provided lab repository. I also started working on the hardware pieces by cutting the base structure on which all the components will be glued. Then I connected the 2 DC motors to the L298N module and added their required functions to the code.

### Week 12 - 18 May

This week, I finished the code and functions for the DC motors (final adjustments), created the basic function for the IOE-SR05 sensor and created the web app for the remote control, including the TCP server and http converter. In terms of harware, I finished the setup (wiring, fixing the ball caster that replaces the wheels in the back, fixing the sensor onto the acrylic plate).

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

The car uses a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W microcontroller that manages motor control and sensor input. I included 2 motors with gearbox and attached wheels that allow movement in 4 directions (left, right, forward, backward) as well as stopping the movement when the user presses the " stop" button. The 2 DC motors are controlled through PWM signal via a L298N module. The module recieves enable / direction signals from the Pico.
An IOE-SR05 Ultrasonic sensor is attached in the front and used for distance measurement and mapping. It provides feedback for the user to help avoid obstacles. Finally, for debugging, a Raspberry Pi Pico 1 was as it helped in testing the hardware components and developing the source code.
