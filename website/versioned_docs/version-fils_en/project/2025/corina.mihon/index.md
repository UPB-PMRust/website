## Description

This project uses a heart rate sensor to monitor the user's pulse. The user can select a mode (for example: exercising) and then the heart beat is shown on a display. If the rate is too high, an LED pulses in a rhythm that guides the user to breath in and out slowly. The heart rate history is displayed on a web interface via Wi-Fi.

## Motivation

I chose this project because of the increasing importance of stress management and heart health. By combining heart rate monitoring with breathing exercises, users can make adjustments to improve their physical health or their mental health. It is a way of integrating technology into wellness practices.

## Architecture 

![Diagram](Diagram.webp)

The main controller reads physiological data from the pulse sensor and controls an LED for visual breathing guidance. A button connected to the microcontroller allows user interaction and the display, also connected to the microcontroller, shows the data. The device also hosts a web interface over Wi-Fi, while a  second microcontroller handles debugging. 

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 5 - 11 May

I connected the main Raspberry Pi Pico 2W with the second one that I use as a debbuger. I also connected the pulse sensor and implemented the basic pulse reading functionality and after that I displayed the measured BPM on the screen.

### Week 12 - 18 May

I displayed on the screen the menu for the mode(either exercising or relaxing). I connected the LEd module and added LED feedback to guide breathing during abnormal BPM, implemented PWM for light transitions and added the button to select the mode.

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

Raspberry Pi Pico 2W: main controller for handling sensor data, controlling the LED and hosting the Wi-Fi web interface

Raspberry Pi Pico 2W: used for debugging

XD-58C pulse sensor: measure the user's heart rate

RBG LED: used for the visual breathing feedback

Button: allows the user to switch between modes

1.44'' LCD Display: Displays the heart rate
