## Hardware
In my project, the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller serves as the central processing unit, mandated for the task. Its low power consumption ensures efficiency throughout. It also reads data and time from the DS3231 real time clock module and DHT22 Sensor and displays them, while also being able to send electrical signals to a motion sensor for an alarm effect.
