## Description
Built around the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W microcontroller, this project integrates an RFID reader, Wi-Fi-based control, a matrix keypad, LCD feedback display, and a servo motor attatched by an iron wire to a door latch. The goal is to provide secure, user-friendly access control that can be managed both locally and remotely.
## Motivation
I've been brainstorming project ideas with a friend who shares my passion for technology and automation earlier this year. We came up with a few concepts for the Innovation Labs competition, with smart-home equipment being a central theme. Although we weren’t able to participate, the idea of creating a smart device stuck with me. When the time came to choose a project for this course, I knew I wanted to pursue something in that direction. That’s how I arrived at the idea of building a versatile smart lock system.

### How it works

### Initialization: 
The system boots and initializes all components. The LCD displays a waiting message.

### Authentication:

***RFID:*** When a card is detected, its UID is checked against a known list.

***Keypad***: A valid PIN entered via the keypad is accepted.

***Wi-Fi***: Pressing the "Unlock" button on the web app sends a request that, if received, triggers the unlock.

### Unlocking: 
A validated user causes the servo to open the lock and display a message for a few seconds.

### Locking: 
After a delay, the servo returns to the locked position.


## Log
### Week 5 - 11 May
Once my project idea was approved, I ordered most of the required components and began implementation step by step. I started by configuring the second Pico as a debugger. After that, I got the RFID reader to work, successfully lighting up a LED upon tag detection. After that, I moved on to integrating the LCD display through I2C.

### Week 12 - 18 May
All key systems are now integrated: RFID, keypad, LCD, buzzer, LEDs, servo, and web control, functioning together as a full access system. This week, I've focused heavily on the web server integration and improving the interactivity through hardware and HTML:

1. Wi-Fi access point successfully configured on the Pico using the CYW43 chip.

2. Served a responsive HTML page from the Pico via a TCP server with an Unlock button.
   Pressing the web button now:
  - Toggles a physical LED
  - Unlocks the servo motor
  - Displays "Access Granted" on the LCD
  - Buzzer plays a confirmation tone

3. Hardware Additions/Changes:
  - I've had some problems with setting up the old LCD Display so I've bought a new 1.44" ST7735S Display that is now fully configured through SPI.
  - 4x4 keypad used for PIN entry and set up a 5 digit code.
  - Servo motor connected to a physical lock mechanism using a wire. It physically moves to unlock or lock a door latch.
  - 5V active buzzer connected via an NPN transistor. Produces sounds for granted and denied access.
  - Second LED that lights up only when access is denied.

4. Functionality:
  - Full locking cycle: The displays shows "Waiting for Access Card or PIN". The system unlocks in one of the 3 ways(RFID, PIN, WEB).Lights up the LED, plays a sound on the buzzer, shows "Access Granted" on the display, puts the servo motor in the unlocked position, pulling the door latch, shows a 5 second countdown on the LCD, then re-locks.

### Week 19 - 25 May


## Hardware
The hardware setup is centered around the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W, with its built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. A variety of peripherals are used to create an interactive, multi-authentication smart lock system.

**Components Used**


**Raspberry Pi Pico 2W**            Central microcontroller; manages all logic and peripherals               
  **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W**             Microcontroller configured as a debugger for the central Pico             
  **RC522 RFID Reader**                SPI-based tag reader for user authentication                              
  **1.44inch SPI Module ST7735S**      Displays system messages over SPI.                   
  **4x4 Matrix Keypad**                Used to enter a  PIN code for access                                      
  **SG90 Micro Servo Motor**           Drives the door lock mechanism (via PWM control)                          
  **Active Buzzer**                    Emits audio feedback upon certain actions (e.g. denied access)            
  **LEDs**                             Status indicator (access granted, access denied)                            
  **External 5V Power Source**         Provides sufficient current for the LCD and servo motor
