## Description
A simple mood tracking device that allows users to record their daily emotional state by pressing buttons. The device saves these states and displays a graph of the last 7 days on a small LCD screen, providing a visual representation of emotional patterns.After the 7 inputs a mood analysis will be done via ChatGPT with its API

## Motivation
I chose this project because keeping track of one's emotional state can be beneficial for mental health awareness. A physical device with simple button inputs makes the process of mood tracking more tangible and accessible than smartphone apps, potentially encouraging more consistent usage. I'm also interested in creating a device that combines hardware interaction with data visualization.

## Architecture
The main components of the system are:
- **Input Module**: Buttons for mood selection (happy/sad/neutral)
- **Storage Module**: EEPROM for persistent mood data storage
- **Processing Unit**: Raspberry Pi Pico W as the central controller
- **Display Module**: LCD screen for visualization of mood data
- **Audio Feedback Module**: Sound output for interaction confirmation

These components interact as follows:
- User inputs mood via button presses
- The Processing Unit registers the input and stores it in the EEPROM
- The Processing Unit retrieves historical data from EEPROM
- The Processing Unit processes data and generates visualization
- The Display Module shows the mood history graph
- The Audio Module provides feedback sounds for interactions

## Log

## Hardware

![Hardware](Hardware.webp)

The project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico W as the main controller, with a 2.4" LCD screen for display, a TPA3118 mono audio amplifier for sound feedback, and an AT24C256 EEPROM module for data storage. Buttons for input and basic resistors are used for the interface.
