## Description

CactusCare is a smart monitoring and watering system designed specifically for cactus plants. It uses a soil humidity sensor to detect moisture levels and decides when watering is needed. If the soil remains too dry for a set period, a small water pump activates to deliver just enough water, preventing overwatering. A water level sensor checks if the reservoir is empty, and an LCD display notifies the user only when a refill is needed. An RGB LED indicates the soil's wet or dry status. Additionally, the system connects to a remote mobile or web app over Wi-Fi, allowing users to monitor sensor readings and manually control watering from anywhere.

## Motivation

CactusCare was designed to make cactus care easier and smarter. It monitors soil moisture and waters the plant only when needed, preventing overwatering or neglect. With a water level sensor and simple LCD alerts, users are notified only when the reservoir is empty. This helps save water, keeps the cactus healthy, and reduces the need for constant attention.

## Architecture 

The CactusCare system is designed to automate the monitoring and watering of cactus plants. It utilizes various sensors and actuators connected to a Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller and includes Wi-Fi capability to allow remote monitoring and control through an app.

1. **Microcontroller:** Raspberry Pi Pico W
Function: Acts as the central processing unit, reading sensor data and controlling actuators.

    **Connections:**

    **Soil Moisture Sensor:** Reads analog voltage corresponding to soil moisture levels.

    **Water Level Sensor:** Monitors the water reservoir level.

    **RGB LED:** Indicates soil moisture status (e.g., green for moist, red for dry).

    **LCD Display:** Displays messages, such as low water alerts.

    **Water Pump:** Activated when soil is dry and water is available.

    **Wi-Fi Module (built-in):** Connects to a remote app for monitoring and control.

2. **Soil Moisture Sensor**
    **Function:** Measures the moisture content of the soil.

    **Connection:** Analog output connected to an ADC pin on the Pico W.

3. **Water Level Sensor**
    **Function:** Detects the water level in the reservoir to prevent dry pumping.

    **Connection:** Digital or analog output connected to the Pico W.

4. **RGB LED**
    **Function:** Provides a visual indication of soil moisture status.

    **Connection:** Three GPIO pins control the red, green, and blue channels.

5. **LCD Display**
    **Function:** Displays system messages, such as "Water Reservoir Empty."

    **Connection:** Typically connected via I²C interface to the Pico W.

6. **Water Pump**
    **Function:** Irrigates the plant when soil moisture is low.

    **Connection:** Controlled via a relay module connected to a GPIO pin.

7. **Remote App (Web/Mobile)**
    **Function:** Allows users to remotely check soil moisture and water level status, and optionally trigger watering.
    **Connection:** Communicates with the Raspberry Pi Pico W over Wi-Fi (e.g., via HTTP or MQTT).

8. **Power Supply**
    **Function:** Provides necessary voltage and current to the system.

    **Components:** Battery pack or USB power source.

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 5 - 11 May


I managed to get my hand on all of the necessary components that i have to use for my project.I also soldered my components so that I can use them in my project. I connected my Raspberry Pi Pico 2W and the debugger and tested them using a simple code.

### Week 12 - 18 May


This week, I successfully connected and integrated all the main components of my project. I wired the LCD display, RGB LED, soil moisture sensor, water level sensor, Raspberry Pi Pico 2W. After assembling the full setup, I tested it with a real plant and used an actual water container for the irrigation system. 

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

This project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico W as the main controller to automate plant watering. A soil humidity sensor monitors the moisture level in the soil, while a water level sensor checks if there is enough water in the reservoir. An RGB LED visually indicates the soil's condition—dry or wet—and an LCD module displays a warning when the reservoir is empty. When the soil is dry and water is available, a small water pump motor is activated to water the plant through connected tubing. All components are connected using a breadboard, jumper wires, and appropriate resistors, and the system is powered by a battery for portability.
