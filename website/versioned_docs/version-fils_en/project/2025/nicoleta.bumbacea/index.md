## Description

The project is a door security system built using a Raspberry Pi Pico 2, programmed in Rust. The system locks the door and requires a 4-digit code to unlock. When the correct code is entered, a green LED turns on, a confirmation sound is played, and the door unlocks. If the wrong code is entered, a red LED turns on, a warning sound is played, and a photo is taken using an Adafruit OV5640 Camera Module. This image is then stored for security purposes.â€‹


## Motivation

I chose this project because it combines embedded systems, security, and real-world problem-solving. Door security is a practical application, and building a smart lock system allows me to explore key concepts such as keypad input handling, device control with GPIO, audio/visual feedback, and basic image capture using a camera module.

## Architecture 
The project includes the following main components:

Input Handler: Captures the 4-digit PIN via a matrix keypad.

PIN Validator: Compares the input against a stored code.

Control Logic: Determines if the door should unlock or log an intruder.

Feedback System: Uses LEDs and buzzer to provide visual and audio feedback.

Communication Module: Sends a UART signal to ESP32-CAM to take a picture.

Image Handler: Receives image data over UART or forwards it to a connected device.

## Log


### Week 5 - 11 May

### Week 12 - 18 May

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

Raspberry Pi Pico 2W - Acts as the central microcontroller running the embedded Rust program.Handles keypad scanning, logic processing, UART communication, GPIO control for LEDs, buzzer, relay.

4x4 Matrix Keypad - Used for user input; allows the user to enter the 4-digit access code.

Green LED-Indicates successful code entry and that the door is being unlocked.

Red LED-Indicates failed code entry or unauthorized access attempt.

Piezo Buzzer - Provides audio feedback.

Relay Module (1 Channel, 5V) - Switches high-current 5V to drive the solenoid.

Solenoid Lock - Mechanically controls the locking/unlocking of the door.

Camera Module - Captures an image when an incorrect code is entered.

Power Supply (USB or 5V external) -Powers the Raspberry Pi Pico and all connected peripherals.
