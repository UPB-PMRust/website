## Description

The Smart Magnetic Door Lock System is a security device that lets you open a door using a keypad and checks if the door was opened. If the correct password is entered on the keypad, a servo motor unlocks the door. A magnetic sensor on the door checks if it has actually been opened. When the door opens, an LED turns on and the system sends a message over Wi-Fi. The Raspberry Pi Pico W handles everything and stores the passwords on an SD card.

## Motivation

The reason why I chose this project is because it combines several interesting and useful features: a password-protected door lock, door status detection, and Wi-Fi notifications. I believe that this project is a great way to learn how to use components like a keypad, servo motor, SD card, and magnetic sensor with a Raspberry Pi Pico W. 

## Architecture 

![Architecture](Architecture.webp)  
This is the description of the system components and their interactions:

1) **Keypad**  
   - The keypad is the user input interface.  
   - Users input a numeric password which is read by the microcontroller.  

2) **Raspberry Pi Pico W**  
   - Acts as the brain of the system.  
   - Reads the keypad input and compares it against a list of valid passwords stored on an SD card.  
   - If the password is correct, it sends a signal to open the servo motor.  
   - Monitors the magnetic sensor for door state changes.  
   - Sends a Wi-Fi message if the door is opened.  

3) **SD Card Module**  
   - Stores one or more valid passwords in a text file.  
   - Connected to the Pico via SPI.  

4) **Servo Motor**  
   - Mechanically unlocks the door when the correct password is entered.  

5) **Magnetic Sensor (Hall Effect)**  
   - Detects whether the door is physically opened.  
   - Triggers the LED and Wi-Fi alert if the door is open.  

6) **LED**  
   - Lights up when the door has been opened.  

7) **Wi-Fi Messaging**  
   - The Pico W sends a message over Wi-Fi when the door is opened.  
   
## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 28 - 4 May
I have started the project following the steps to set-up the gitlab page and I have sketched the documentations
### Week 5 - 11 May

### Week 12 - 18 May

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

The project uses the following components:

1) **Raspberry Pi Pico W** – Central controller.  
2) **4x4 Keypad** – User input interface for password entry.  
3) **Servo Motor** – Controls the door lock mechanism.  
4) **Magnetic Sensor** – Detects whether the door is open.  
5) **LED (5 mm)** – Visual indicator for door-open event.  
6) **SD Card Module** – Stores passwords in a file.  
7) **USB** – Powers the Pico and servo.

### Schematics

This is the Kicad Schematic:

Instead of a keypad schematic I have used connection pins to represent the rows and columns of the keypad in the KiCad representation of the project
