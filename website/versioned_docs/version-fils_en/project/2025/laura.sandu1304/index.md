## Description

My project makes it possible to play Sudoku by inputting the numbers and moving from one cell to another by using a keyboard module. The game is visible on a webpage on the laptop. Games are previously added and players can choose what difficulty to play. Players will be able to start a new game, input numbers, use the undo and redo operations and check if their answers are correct.

Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number placement puzzle. The objective is to fill the 9x9 grid with numbers so that each column, each row, and each 3x3 subgrid contain the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.

The game helps with cognitive stimulation by improving memory, concentration and logic, and also provides a calming effect and a sense of accomplishment.

## Motivation

I have been playing Sudoku on and off since I was a little child, and over time, it became one of my favorite comfort games to play. The game is pretty easy and straightforward, and I thought it would be perfect to make it the subject of my project.

## Log

### Before week 5 - 11 May

I had bought all necessary components way before and wired the Picos first. I flashed my debugger and then made sure everything worked by running the lab skeleton with the "Hello, world!" program. 

Then I wired my keyboard module to make sure it worked properly, and wrote a program to get input from it in the terminal. After multiple tries and checks of the wiring and the code, I still didn't manage to do it.

### Week 5 - 11 May
 
This week I finally managed to make the keyboard module work by continuously trying to find other solutions and methods to make it work. 

Then I got started on the game logic.

### Week 12 - 18 May

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware
* Raspberry Pi Pico 2W - main microcontroller used for game logic
* Raspberry Pi Pico - debugger    
* Keyboard module - number keyboard used for input and other controls 

The pins of the keyboard module have a very interesting configuration. There are 9 pins, of which the first and last are NC (No Connect) pins. The remaining 7 pins each correspond to a row or a column. The picture below clearly shows the pin configuration.
