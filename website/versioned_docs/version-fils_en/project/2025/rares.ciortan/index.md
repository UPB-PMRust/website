## Description
Pocket Poker is a single-player Texas Hold'em-style poker game that runs entirely on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W, using a 1.8" SPI TFT LCD for the displays and push buttons for input. The game allows the player to go head-to-head against a simple AI dealer, simulating betting rounds, card dealing, and hand evaluation. All logic and graphics are written in Rust, demonstrating how embedded systems can be used for interactive, game-like applications without requiring internet or external screens.

## Motivation
I wanted to create something more interactive and fun than traditional embedded projects. Poker is a great balance of logic, randomness, and user interface work. This project is a chance to explore Rust for embedded systems, work with SPI-based LCDs, and implement game logic on limited hardware.

## Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](Poker.webp)

**Raspberry Pi Pico 2W**: Acts as the main controller. Runs the game logic written in Rust. Communicates with the displays via SPI and handles button input through GPIO.
-**Connection**: Communicates with the display via SPI and handles button input through GPIO.

**Buttons**: Used for player inputs (Check,Bet,Fold).
-**Connection**: Each button is connected to a GPIO pin with pull-down resistors for clean signals.
**Displays**: Used to show the table cards, your cards, balance of both players/game state.
-**Connection**: Connected via SPI (MOSI and CLK), plus control pins (CS, DC, RST).

## Log
### Week 5-11 May
In this week I mostly made the documentation, containing the description, motivation, architecture showing how it would work more or less, the start of the hardware section, bill of materials, list of software i might use, and some links to websites.
### Week 12-18 May
This week I finished building the hardware, bought a few more items I needed and updated the documentation with the kicad schematic, a photo of the hardware built and added the hardware i bought to the bill of materials. I tested to see if the displays were connected properly and they were fine.
### Week 19-25 May
For the last week, i started creating the software. It went well for the most part, but had a few issues with making the lcd displays work. In the end, with a bit of help, i managed to make them work, while still encountering some problems that I solved in the meantime. I pushed the code when i remembered, usually after making a big change or adding something important. Making the software for the poker game wasn't necessarily complicated, but it just took a long time, i spent basically all of my weekend and a few hours each day trying to make the game work. What i managed to make is a display that shows one of my cards, one that shows the other card, and the last one that shows the flop, turn and river cards when i press the check button. at the end of the turns, the opponent(programmed him to recieve cards too) would have his hand revealed on the display, and in vscode I show the pairs we each had, who won and what ammount of money bet you recieved. I made three types of buttons with different functions: the CHECK button witch I already talked about, the BET button which allows me to bet a fixed amount of money and a fold button, which basically starts a new game.
Also the money you have in the bank remains in between games, until you restart the software. 

## Hardware
The hardware consists of a raspberry pi pico 2W microcontroller as the core unit, around 3 displays used for displaying the cards, balance etc. , buttons for checking, folding, betting.
