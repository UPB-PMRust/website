## Description

My project is a "Whack-a-Mole" game. It features four moles that briefly pop up (for about one second each) in random order. A mole will go down either when the time runs out or if the player successfully hits it, in which case the player scores a point. This continues for 20 seconds, after which the total score is displayed on the screen.

## Motivation

In all honesty, I chose this idea for my project because my sister had planned to do it last year but had to abandon it due to time constraints.

## Architecture 

1. **Start and Restart buttons**
    -used to start and restart the game

2. **Screen**
    -displays your final score at the end of the game

3. **Game Area**
    -4 sets of "moles" that consist of one servo motor and one micro-switch each
    
    -the motors are connected to a source of 5V and 10A

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 10 - 28 April

As of right now, I have a prototype that has LEDs and buttons instead of the motors and switches. Next, I need to 3D model the game area of my project before replacing the LEDs with the motors and other components.

### Week 12 - 18 May

I replaced the leds and coded the game with the servo-motors and switches. 

## Hardware

This was the prototype for the game in which i had leds that would represent the moles going up and buttuns instead of switches.

This is how the game looks right now without the 3D printed parts of the game.

**Raspberry Pi Pico W**
    -Central microcontroller \
    -runs the program
    
**Source (5V-10A  LRS-50-5 MEAN WELL)**
    -used specifically for the servos

**Servo motors (MG996R)x4**
    -used to push up the moles
    
**Micro-switches x4**

**Display (LCD 2.4'' SPI ILI9341)**
