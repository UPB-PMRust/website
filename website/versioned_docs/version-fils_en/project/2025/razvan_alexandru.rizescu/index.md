# Description

Built around a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller and a DS3231 real-time clock module, the system uses a relay-controlled water pump and a buzzer to deliver both audio and physical alerts when the alarm time is reached. The alarm time is easily configurable through a simple frontend web interface. This project combines embedded hardware design with Rust-based software development to create a reliable, fun, and slightly mischievous alarm system. With a modular architecture, clear schematics, and robust software design, it‚Äôs a perfect example of how creative engineering can solve everyday problems in unexpected ways.

## üéØ Motivation

Since I was 14 years old, I struggled to wake up to traditional alarms. Most mornings, I would snooze or sleep through them. This project solves that by introducing an unavoidable physical stimulus ‚Äî **a blast of water** ‚Äî triggered by a reliable, time-based microcontroller system.

## üìÜ Weekly Development Log

### Week 6-12 May

-In the first week after deciding on my project, I ordered the necessary components and worked on schematics, architecture and documentation, planning everything that i want to do in my head, first important features, possible future features.

## üõ† Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Pico reads time and controls outputs.
- Relay safely drives the water pump.
- All powered via USB.
- RTC provides persistent and accurate timekeeping.
- When the current time matches the alarm:
  - Triggers a **buzzer** for audio alert.
  - Activates a **water pump** to spray water on the user.
- Both components run until manually stopped.
- Alarm time is set via a **simple frontend web app**.
