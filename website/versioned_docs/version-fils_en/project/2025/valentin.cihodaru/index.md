## Description

An mp3/wav player that reads the song from a sd card and plays it on a bluetooth speaker. The mp3 
player also has a potentiometer that is used to change the volume, a play/pause button and skip 
song and backwards buttons. 
## Motivation

I chose this project because I think an mp3 bluetooth player that has the songs stored offline can be helpful when there is no internet access.
