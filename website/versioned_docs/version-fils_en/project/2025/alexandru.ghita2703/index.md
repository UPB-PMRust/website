## Description

This project builds a small autonomous parking car, using Raspberry Pi Pico 2W programmed in Rust with Embassy. The car uses three ultrasonic sensors to detect a parking space and automatically perform a parking maneuver using tank steering. A simple web interface on the Pico 2W shows the parking status and allows the user to confirm the parking if needed.

## Motivation

I chose this project because I wanted to understand how automated parking systems work, like the one in my Renault 2024. I noticed the real system sometimes struggles, so I decided to create a basic prototype to see how parking detection and control could be implemented with simple sensors and motors. I also wanted to practice using Rust in embedded systems.

## Architecture 

The system is made up of a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W that runs all the logic. It reads data from three ultrasonic sensors:

one at the front-center (to detect obstacles ahead),

one at the right-front (to detect the start of a parking space),

one at the right-rear (to detect the end of the parking space).

The Pico 2W also controls the two motors (using tank steering) through a TB6612FNG driver. It hosts a simple web interface that shows if a parking space was found and allows the user to press a button to start parking.

When a space is detected, the car either starts parking automatically or waits for confirmation through the web interface. The parking maneuver is done by reversing with tank steering.

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 5 - 11 May
Built the car and developed stable automatic parking algorithm with PWM motor control and sensor-based logic.
### Week 12 - 18 May
Calibrated the parking stages duration (to make sure the car parks as good as possible), integrated Wi-Fi support and added web interface plan with special parking maneuver detection.
### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

The car is built on a 2-wheel drive chassis from a robot kit. It uses two DC motors controlled by a TB6612FNG motor driver. Three ultrasonic sensors (2x HC-SR04 and 1x HC-SR04+) are used to detect obstacles and parking space. A Raspberry Pi Pico 2W runs the control program. Power is provided by 4x AA batteries in a holder with a switch.
