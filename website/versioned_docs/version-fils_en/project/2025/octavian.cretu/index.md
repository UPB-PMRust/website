## Description

This project aim is to develop a smart door lock system powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W. It uses a fingerprint sensor to authenticate users, a servo motor to simulate locking and unlocking the door, and a buzzer to signal access. An LED display shows real-time status messages, while an ultrasonic sensor monitors the door's open or closed state. The system combines biometric security with sensor-based monitoring to create an interactive and responsive door locking simulation.

## Motivation

I chose this project because I’ve always found fingerprint matching really interesting. The idea that you can use something as unique as a fingerprint to unlock a door seemed like a fun and useful concept to explore. I wanted to learn how to use a fingerprint sensor with a microcontroller and see how everything works together. This project also lets me combine different parts like a servo motor, buzzer, LED display, and ultrasonic sensor to create a full system. By using the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W programmed in Rust, I’m gaining a better understanding of how Rust works in embedded systems, especially with its concurrency features, and async behavior for handling multiple tasks efficiently.

## Architecture 
![Architecture photo](./Architecture.webp)

1. **Authentication Module**
    - Handles fingerprint scanning and matching.
    - Communicates with the fingerprint sensor over UART.
    - Sends authentication results (success/failure) to the Control Module.

2. **Control Module**
    - Core decision-making unit of the system.
    - Receives input from the Authentication Module and Sensor Interface.
    - Controls actuators (servo, buzzer) and updates the display.
    - Manages system states such as Locked, Unlocked.

3. **Sensor Interface**
    - Reads distance data from the ultrasonic sensor using GPIO.
    - Determines if the door is open or closed.
    - Sends door state updates to the Control Module.

4. **Actuator Interface**
    - Controls output devices.
    - Servo Motor via PWM for locking/unlocking.
    - Buzzer via GPIO or PWM for alerts.

5. **Display Interface**
    - Updates the LED display with system status messages (e.g., "Locked", "Access Granted").
    - Communicates with the display using I2C.


## Log

<!-- write every week your progress here -->

### Week 10 - 28 April - 4 May
Assembeled componenets on a breadboard and tested how they all work separately. \
Started working on interfacing with the R503 fingerprint sensor.

Made the fingerprint sensor work with three basic operations. Register fingerprint, verify fingerprint and remove fingerprint. \
Added led color changing as well.

### Week 11 - 5 May - 11 May
Added the other devices one by one to the project and programmed them depending on the locks state (such as Locked, Unlocked or Register Fingerprint). \
Switched to async tasks for every device, coordinated through a pubsub channel, which transmits the current door state.
Found out I need an aditional power source for the devices.

### Week 12 - 12 May - 18 May
Remade the kicad schematic. \
Set up a cardboard box mock-up to simulate the Smart Lock in a real-world scenario. Integrated all components into the enclosure and tested system functionality, including fingerprint authentication, locking mechanism, and status display. \
Rewrote some of the logic for the fingerprint sensor. 


## Hardware
**Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W:**
    - Central microcontroller that manages all inputs, outputs, and logic.
    - Runs the program written in Rust.

**Fingerprint Sensor (R503):**
    - Authenticates users by matching scanned fingerprints with stored data.
    - Communicates with the Pico via UART.

**Servo Motor:**
    - Simulates the physical locking and unlocking of the door.
    - Controlled via a PWM signal from the Pico.

**Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04):**
    - Detects if the door is open or closed by measuring distance.
    - Uses GPIO pins for trigger and echo.

**LED Display (LCD 1602 - I2C):**
    - Shows system status messages like "Locked", "Access Granted", or "Register Fingerprint".
    - Communicates with the Pico via I2C.

**Buzzer:**
    - Sounds a short alert when the door is unlocked or about to be locked.
    - Controlled via PWM.

**Breadboard Power source:**
    - Supplies power to components with higher current requirements, ensuring stable operation of the project.
