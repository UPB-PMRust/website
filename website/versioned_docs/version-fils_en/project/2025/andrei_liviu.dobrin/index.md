## Description

This project implements a "Simon Says" memory game using 9 LEDs and a numpad. The game logic runs on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W. An I2C-connected 16x2 LCD screen displays a start menu, current score, and high score saved in the microcontroller's flash memory.

## Motivation

I chose this project to combine embedded hardware and software concepts in a fun and interactive way. It challenges both my circuit design skills and my ability to use Rust in embedded development.

## Architecture 

The project is made up of several parts that work together to create the Simon Says game:

### Game Logic
- This is the main part of the program.
- It controls the flow of the game: when it starts, how patterns are shown, and when the game ends.

### Pattern Generator
- Generates a random sequence of LEDs that the player has to remember and repeat.
- The sequence gets longer each round to make the game more challenging.

### Input Handler
- Listens for button presses from the 4x3 keypad.
- Checks if the player's input matches the generated pattern.

### Output Handler
- Controls the 9 LEDs to display the pattern.
- Sends messages to the LCD screen (like score, "You Win", or "Game Over").
- Activates the buzzer to give sound feedback for actions.

### Score System
- Keeps track of the player’s current score.
- Saves the highest score in the microcontroller's flash memory so it’s not lost when powered off.

### How everything connects
- The **Game Logic** tells the **Pattern Generator** to make a new sequence.
- The **Input Handler** reads the player’s buttons and tells the **Game Logic** if it was correct.
- The **Output Handler** lights up the LEDs, updates the screen, and beeps the buzzer.
- The **Score System** stores the highest score and updates it when needed.

### Week 5 - 11 May
Started working on my Simon Says game using a Raspberry Pi Pico2W and Rust. Chose this project to explore embedded Rust and hardware interaction. Defined the concept: 9 inline LEDs, 4x3 keypad, buzzer, and 16x2 LCD. Focused on planning and selecting components.
### Week 12 - 18 May
Connected the LCD via I2C and displayed simple messages. Tested individual LEDs and the buzzer to confirm they work correctly. Began setting up the breadboard layout for the full game circuit. Verified power supply and pin assignments
### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware
The Simon Says game is built around several key hardware components, each playing a crucial role in its functionality:

*   **Raspberry Pi Pico W**: It acts as the central microcontroller, responsible for running the game logic, generating light patterns, reading player input, and controlling the display and buzzer.
*   **16x2 I2C LCD Screen**: Displays game information to the player.
*   **LEDs (x9)**: Provide the primary visual output for the game. They light up in specific sequences that the player must memorize and replicate using the numpad.
*   **330Ω Resistors (x9)**: Act as current-limiting resistors for each of the 9 LEDs, protecting them from damage by ensuring they receive the correct amount of electrical current.
*   **10kΩ Resistors (x9)**: Used as pull-down resistors for the numpad buttons. They ensure that each button input pin on the microcontroller reads a defined LOW state when a button is not pressed, preventing floating inputs.
*   **Breadboard**: A prototyping board that helps to assembly all electronic components without soldering.
*   **Jumper Wires**: Wires used to establish electrical connections.
*   **Buzzer**: An auditory output device that provides sound feedback for various game events, such as correct or incorrect button presses, level completion, or game over signals.
*   **Numpad**: The main input interface for the player. It is used to enter the sequence of lights they have memorized, attempting to match the pattern shown by the LEDs.
*   **Breadboard Power Supply**: Provides the voltage from an external source to power all components on the breadboard.
