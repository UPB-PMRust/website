## Description

A chess engine and game running on the Pico that users can play on a LCD display using a keyboard:

- The game uses the display to allow the users to select the game mode: Player vs Player or Player vs AI.
- The chess engine provided the validation and move generation AIs. 
- A buzzer is used to serve different information about the cursor movement and piece and menu selections.

## Motivation

I choose this project as I am passionate about chess and wanted to see the extent to which a chess engine could run on a mirco controller.
I knew this involved a lot of optimization and wanted to take the challange.

### Week 6 - 12 May

### Week 7 - 19 May

### Week 20 - 26 May

## Hardware

For the project, the following were used:

- A Raspberry Pi Pico 2W for controlling the Display(Drawing to it), the MPR Keyboard Module(Getting input), the Active Buzzer Module and running the game loop and Chess Engine.
- The ILI9341 LCD 240x320 Display was used to provide the user with the game GUI.
- The MPR121 Keyboard Module provided the used input for piece movement and game mode selection.
- The active buzzer was intented to offer an acustic signal to confirm keyboard press.
