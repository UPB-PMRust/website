## Description

I grew up surrounded by pets  at home, and one recurring challenge we faced as a family was planning vacations. We often had to limit our travel plans because it was difficult to find someone reliable to feed our pets while we were away. This inspired me to design a Smart Pet Feeder system built using a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W and Rust. The feeder dispenses food at scheduled times or remotely via wi-fi control. To make pet care more convenient and give pet owners more freedom and peace of mind when traveling.

## Motivation

I believe this could be a practical solution to real-life problems I've faced. Even if the project might seem a bit silly, I’m excited to have fun working with the hardware I've invested in.

## Architecture 

Main Components:

![Architecture](./assets/schema1v2.webp)

Raspberry Pico 2W: Acts as the central processing unit for the Pet Feeder, controlling the sensors and motors.

Ultrasonic Distance Sensor HC-SR04+: Detects when a pet is near the feeder.

Servo Motor SG90: Drives the mechanism to dispense the pet food.

LCD 1602: Displays a message when the object is detected.

Power Supply: Provides the necessary power to all components at 5V.
 
Wi-Fi Module: Facilitates communication with external devices.

Connection Overview:
The Raspberry Pi Pico 2W acts as the central controller of the Pet Feeder, directly interfacing with the ultrasonic distance sensor (HC-SR04+), the SG90 servomotor, and an LCD1602 display. When the pet approaches the feeder, the sensor detects proximity, and the Pico 2W automatically activates the servo to dispense food. Simultaneously, the LCD1602 displays relevant status messages such as "Object detected" and the current measured distance, providing real-time feedback.
The Pico also runs a Wi-Fi access point and hosts a local web server, allowing the owner to manually trigger feeding from a browser interface. The SG90 servomotor is responsible for physically releasing food from a dedicated container and is powered by a stable 5V supply. The ultrasonic distance sensor ensures that food is only dispensed when the pet is actually nearby, preventing unnecessary activation.
This architecture ensures seamless interaction between sensing, actuation, and user control, enabling both automatic and manual feeding through reliable, Wi-Fi-based communication, with the Pico 2W orchestrating all core functions and the LCD1602 providing local visual feedback.
